# Institutional Trading

Institutional trading is the study of SMART MONEY CONCEPTS & the way of trading in the instituional way.

## ICT WENT SERIES
### Swing Points

Swing points are the points where we can get to know the where the swing has ended in uptrend or downtrend.

**Swing High :-**

In swing high middle 3 candles setup in which middle candle is higher one, and lower high on left & lower high on right candle to it as mentioned below.

<img src="./assets/went/swing-high.png" alt="">

**Swing Low :-**

In swing low middle candle setup in which middle candle is lower candle, and higher low on left & higher low on right candles to it.

<img src="./assets/went/swing-low.png" alt="">

**Chart Analysis :-**

Draw horizontal lines of the range of swing low & swing high pattern, dont missout any swing high's & lows' it will lead to market reversal which would not be planned by you.

**Rules :-**

- If any levels are matching nearby avoid remarking that level with tiny difference.

- If any new swing high & low forms within the marked range then we dont need to redraw again because we are considering major swing high & low points. the newly swing high & low formed within the range could be considered as secondary points.

<img src="./assets/went/swing-points-analysis.png" alt="">

**Importance :-**

There is importance of open, high, low & close of 3 of the candles in swing high & swing low pattern, those are the important & sensitive price levels to which price reacts & respects.

### Excercise 1

**Analysis :-**

- Mark the daily & weekly swing low's & high's on the chart where support & resistance levels are overlapping.

- Turn on daily & weekly time sepration on the chart.

**Actions :-**

- Buy on daily & weekly lows with 1:1 ratio of 20 pips.  
  
- Sell on daily & weekly highs with 1:1 ratio of 20 pips.

This excersice builds the acceptance of looses & builds the discipling required for waiting for our setups.

Analyze the trades & checkout how much profit & loss you have booked for the month.

### Market Structure

Before studying market structure we need to have our framework for our analysis, Which depends on your trading style.

We get overwhelmed when we analyze the things on multiple time frames but according to our trading style we should analyze the market structure by using 3 timeframes only as mentioned below.

<img src="./assets/went/timeframes.png" alt="">

**Purpose of multiple-timeframes :-**

- **Bigger timeframe : -** 
    
  We use bigger timeframes to analyze the market direction & moves.

- **Medium timeframe :-** 
  
  We use Medium timeframe to manage our trade like adjusting stoplosses etc.

- **Smaller timeframe :-** 
  
  We use smaller timeframe for our entries & checking out the early reversal signals through it & booking our profits accordingly.

**Uptrend Market Structure :-**

<img src="./assets/went/uptrend.png">

We look for market strucuture we checkout on bigger timeframe in our framework, and Whenever is pricing moving up it makes consolidation to grab some more buy orders & it continues its strucutre to upwards as mentioned above.

The market structure will be respected to major supply zone on bigger timeframe, and when it breaks previous 2 swing low's it does mean price got reversed.

**Downtrend Market Structure :-**

<img src="./assets/went/downtrend.png">

We look for market strucuture we checkout on bigger timeframe in our framework, and Whenever is pricing moving down it makes consolidation to grab some more sell orders & it continues its strucutre to downwards as mentioned above.

The market structure will be respected to major demand zone on bigger timeframe, and when it breaks previous 2 swing high's it does mean price got reversed.

**Break of structure :-**

<img src="./assets/went/break-of-structure.png">

When the price reached some demand zone & some important levels & price reverses and break the previous swing low then its confirmation of market versal.

The broken down level of previous `swing low (Uptrend reversal)` & `swing high (Downtrend reversal)` acts as retracement level.

**Long term High/Low :-**

<img src="./assets/went/long-term-high-low.png">

When a High has lower high's on both of side & even lower high's of long swing then its an long term high.

When a low has higher low on both of the side & even higher lows of long swings then its long term low.


**Kill Zone and Key S & R Level :-**

<img src="./assets/went/killzone.png">
When you identify the price action on bigger timeframe of your framework, You dont enter into trade at any point.

You checkout your bigger timeframe bias what your pricing is telling, either bu llish or bearish. And you wait for the kill zone at the key support & resistance levels and then you can take entry with market or pending orders.

**Market Structure Strategy :-**

- Find high & low on the bigger timeframes(Monthly) of your setup & calibrate your high's & low's on weekly chart.

- Mark the range where the market is heading on bigger timeframe(Monthly) & colour it according to buy or sell.

- From the low's wait for break of structure & find out the retracement from `low to newer high (In terms of Uptrend directional bias)` & `High to newer low (In terms of Downtrend directional bias)`

- Wait for price to retrace in your golden zone & wait for reversal signs.

- Take the trades only in long term directional bias direction (Long term trend).

- Continue to the setup of finding the retracement from `long term low (In terms of Uptrend directional bias)` & `long term high (In terms of Downtrend directional bias)` to structured braked `Newer High (In terms of Uptrend directional bias)` & `Newer Low (In terms of Downtrend directional bias)` to grab entries at fibbonacci golden zone & set the targets previous swing levels.

### Support & Resistance

Trading Horizontal Support & Resistance levels doesnt tells us exactly buy to sell but moreon it tells us what levels price can react.

All the indicators are lagging which means they are indicating the signals behind the price thats why in the backtesting it performs well but in the live market it gives us late signals which will lead us to losses.

We should not look for support & resistance levels around the patterns we are looking for instead we should wait for price to reach at those important levels & then we should look for patterns or any other indications which tells us the reversal or continuation of the trend.

<img src="./assets/went/support-resistance.png">

**What Support Resistance tells us :-**

**Support :-**

  Support identifies an area where there buyers going to overwhelm the sellers & waiting for the buy opportunity on that perticular levels.

  Sometimes market makers moves the markets below the support levels as well to collect the pending orders or hit the stoplosses of retail traders & to fill their huge orders by existing retail traders out there.

**Resistance :-**

  Resistance indentifies an area where sellers going to overwhelm the buyers & they were waiting for the sell opportunity on that perticular levels.

  Sometomes market makers moves the market above the resistance levels as well to collect the pending orders or to hit stoplosses of retail traders so they will get exited out of trade & to fill their huge orders.


**Strength of the trend & levels :-**

<img src="./assets/went/sr-strength.png">

When price breaks resistance levels frequently & respects support levels then its very good indication of bullish behaviour.

When the price breaks support levels & respects resistance levels then its very good indication of bearish behaviour.

The more times support & resistance levels respected then its more valid levels.

**Types of Support & Resistance Levels :-**

<img src="./assets/went/sr-types.png">

1. **Natural S&R Levels :-**
   
   We have Natural S&R Levels like in the hirarchyfrom session, daily, highly, weekly, monthly, quaterly, & 12 Month.

   - **12 Month High's Low's :-**

    <img src="./assets/went/sr-yearly.png">

    12 Month High's Low's dont makes setup whole lot but we need to keep a note of yearly high's & low's for longer term directional bias.
  
  - **Quaterly High's Low's :-**

    <img src="./assets/went/sr-quaterly.png">

    Quaterly high's & low's are most important ones for long term swing trades & highly respected as well. We need to keep note of Quaterly high's & low's in our swing trades as its plays very important roles in it.

  - **Monthly High's Low's :-**

    <img src="./assets/went/sr-monthly.png">  

    Multiple opportunities given with the help of monthly high's & low's. We find a lot of setup for swing trades with the help of monthly high's & lows which will gives great returns even without spending a lot of time in front of screen.

  - **Weekly High's Low's :-**

    <img src="./assets/went/sr-weekly.png">

    Weekly high's low's are the levels we look frequently in our swing trades as price respects those levels obidiently. We can catch great moves with the help of weekly high's low's without spending much of time in front of screen.

  - **Daily High's Low's :-**
  
    <img src="./assets/went/sr-daily.png">

    We look for minimum of 3 days of data while considering daily high's low's which gives us the good key levels for intraday trading.

  - **Asian High's & Low's :-**

    <img src="./assets/went/sr-asian.png">

    Asian session high's & low's are very important levels for intraday trading & Scalping.

    On this levels price reacts very well and the asian session high's & low's are specially usefull for London & New York session traders.

    Asian session high's & low's are formed in between `6:30AM to 2:30PM` as per Indian Standard Time.


  - **London session High's & Low's :-**
  
    <img src="./assets/went/sr-london.png">

    London session high's and low's are very influential for New york session traders, There are lot of opportunities forms within london sessions.

    London session high's and low's are formed in between `12:30PM to 8:30PM` as per Indian Standard time.
  
  - **New York session High's & Low's :-**

    <img src="./assets/went/sr-newyork.png">

    New York session high's & low's are important for New day upcoming Asian session. Asian sessions requires refrences high's & low's for previous New York session & London session.

    New York session high's & low's are formed in between `5:30PM to 2:30AM` as per Indian Standard Time.

`Note :- We look for at least 2 previous sessions high's & low's while trading in any kind of session. When we are looking as per bigger timeframe we should look for atleast 2 greater high's & low's In Example if we are looking on daily chart we should look for weekly & monthly high's low's.`
  
 
2. **Implied S&R Levels :-**

  <img src="./assets/went/sr-implied.png"> 

   We have Implied S&R Levels like in the hirarchyfrom session like fibonacci retracements, fibonacci extensions, Pivot points on intrdaday charts like 5m or 15m etc.
  
  When Natural S&R levels & Implied S&R Levels are collapsing or near around each other then its high probability S&R levels which would be respected most of the times.  


**Institutional Price Levels :-**

<img src="./assets/went/sr-institutional.png">

  Institutional Price Levels are not odd number price levels in the market, they are round number levels with 100-300 pips of range like in terms of GBPUSD it would be as mentioned above in the picture.

  They use `.20`, `.50` and `.80` levles for managing the trades and their exits.

  Thats why our price sometimes penetrates through our support & resistance levels on odd price points, it goes till these institutions levels then it reverses or reacts.


### How Commercials Trade

<img src="./assets/went/commercials-trade.png">

Commercials trade in different way, they are long term trader and if they are getting the things at less price they buy, and buy and more buy untill market reaches to important support level.

When the trends reverses then they start selling in the market due to which the retracements forms in ongoing trend due to their profit booking.

**COT Analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/went/cot.png">

COT Chart is the combined chart of commercial, institutional & retail traders Where it explains the their net buying positions range & net Selling position range with actual data of their transactions.

**How to Read Chart :-**

**Thicker Line :-**

  Thicker line represents the commercial traders & their positions with above and below the 0 level.

**Medium Line :-**

  Medium line represents the financial institutions & their positions with above and below the 0 levels.

**Thinner Line :-**

  Thinner line represents the retail traders & their positions with above and below the 0 levels.

Here we only do care about the commercial traders, We know that commercial traders buy when the market is falling so they get the contracts at better prices & they sell when contract prices rises to book their profits.

**Commercial COT :-**

<img src="./assets/went/cot-commercials.png">

<img src="./assets/went/cot-insider.png">

<img src="./assets/went/cot-graphical.png">

In the above chart we can see 12 Month extreme Net long & 12 months extreme net short where posisible market reversal happens.

We dont look for only this COT data to make our decision but we combine support & resistance along with it where we get to know price reached at support level & commercial traders also done with buying.

When the price reverses & commercials start booking profits market retraces in the ongoing trend and thats where we exactly look for sniper entries.

When we notice the short downtrend of commercial orders at point 2 at may month it doesnt means market got reversed but the smaller corrections is happening for collecting for more buy order.

At the point 5 and in the month of september it means commercials done with their buying & when their buying trend is loosing it strength and you can notice when the cot chart goes down to 0 then its huge moment comes in and thats when we put out most our leaverage in. `We look for this kind of opportunities in the market as ict traders.`

**COT Strategy :-**

<img src="./assets/went/oct-trade.png">

1. Trade in the direction of most recent 12 months commitment of traders.

2. Wait for price to form intermidiate term swings retracements and then take entry.
   
3. Use OTE (Optimal Trade Entry) pattern to enter into trade with the help of fibonacci.

4. Take only Buy positions when COT reaches fresh 12 months and or 4 year extremes on commercial net short positions.

5. Take only Sell positions when COT reaches fresh 12 months and or 4 year extremes on commercial net long positions.

6. Combine retracement with support & resistance in the direction of COT guides.

### Weekly High & Low's Importance

<img src="./assets/went/weekly-high-low.png">

Weekly high & low's are the important levels for swing trades with 15m chartsEven simply if you buy at weekly low & sell at weekly high then still you would be profitable.

Weekly High's form in bearish environments in tuesday's or wednsday's london session opening.

Weekly Low's form in bullish enviornments in tuesday's or wednsday's london session opening.

### ICT Kill Zones

ICT kill zones are the time zones from 24 hours of forex markets where highest probabilities trade setup forms.

There are 4 types of kill zones introduced by ICT which are as followed.

**Types of Kill Zones :-**

- **Asian Kill Zone :-**

  `EST - 8pm TO 12am` `IST - 6:30am - 10:30am` is the Asian kill zone is high volatility zone for AUD, NZD & JPY pairs are ideal to trade. According to volatility we can trade `AUD/JPY & NZD/JPY` in Asian kill zone.

  Its charecteristics is the consolidation phase of market & major currency paris which leads to potential trend continuation or reversal.

- **London Open Kill Zone :-**
  
  `EST - 2am TO 5am` `IST - 12:30pm - 3:30pm` is the London Open kill zone is volatility zone for `EUR/USD & GBP/USD` pairs. 

  Its main charecteristics is to create low of the day in bullish market & high of the day in bearish market.

- **New York Kill Zone :-**
  
  `EST - 7am TO 10am` `IST - 5:30pm - 8:30pm` is the New York Kill zone is volatility zone for major pairs coupled with USD like `USD/CHF, USD/CAD, USD/JPY, XAU/USD & XAG/USD` etc.

  Its main charecteristics is either the continuation of london move or complete reversal of it.

- **London Close Kill Zone :-**

  `EST - 10am to 12pm` `IST - 8:30pm - 10:30pm` is the London close kill zone is volatility zone for EUR, GBP, USD coupled pairs.

  Its main charecteristics is to retracement of daily high's or low's & its major area for the change in direction of weekly & daily trend.



- **London Close Kill Zone :-**

### USD Index Corelation with Commodity, Stocks & Currencies

USD Index indirectly indicates the direction of Forex Market such as comodity, stocks & currencies direction if analyzed on higher time frame like 1d & 4h.

When the USD index is up then eveverything else will goes down which is called as `RISK OFF` & when the USD index goes down then everything else will go up and its called as `RISK ON`.

Whenever we start for analysis for forex we should start with USD index on higher timeframe & its swing direction.

<img src="./assets/went/usdindex-relation.png">

You can checkout the EUR/USD Movement directly related to usd index, Both are moving in identical manner but in reverse order.

Nearly Exact respected currencies with respect to USD INDEX are as mentioend below.

- EUR/USD
- GBP/USD
- XAU/USD
- XAG/USD
- USD/CHF

**London Kill Zone Strategy with USD index :-**
- Check out the USD Index move & analyze the market move for your currency pair for today either up day or down day.
- Mark the London open line or london kill zone on chart to check where it breaks fake outs previous swing level.
- Mark the fibs for the high & low of the new trading day swing
- Find the `day high in terms of downtrend day` and `day low in terms of uptrend day`  with the Fibonacci retracement in golden zone & fake out of the previous swing `high in terms of down day` & `low (in terms of up day)`.
- Keep the stop loss of 30 pips above your founded low & high because we are already keeping 1/3 or stop loss of the daily average range of 100 pips even at its highest point.
- Take `SELL trade in terms of down day` and `BUY trade in terms of up day`.
  
We can use 9 and 18 moving average crossovers as well to check long term directional bias & we can mark the zone with appropriate color which will indicate sell directions which we are going to take.

## ICT FOREX SCOUT SNIPER SERIES

### Sniper setups trades classfication

Sniper setups trades are the trades we derive in advance already and we plan everything before trade like entry points, stop loss levels & even take profit levels.

Sniper trade setups can be classified as mainly the setups with advance before time analysis and limit orders for the trade with SL, TP and entry point.

**Factors to be considered while preparing sniper setups :-**
1. Precision Point Entry Prices - Applicable for use of Limit Order.
2. Utilization of specific time of day critiria.
3. Advance knowledge of target prices for positive exit points.
4. Employement of strict risk management protocols.
5. Calm & disciplinary trading without emotions and impatience.

### Swing Points

Swing points are the High's & low's points sourrounded with `Low's having higher 2 high's on both side` & `high's having 2 lower low's on both side` are called as swing points.

We can use the indicator as well for the same in MT5 for it. Insert > Indicators > Bill Williams > Fractals.

<img src="./assets/sniper/swing-points.png">

**Excercise with swing points to understand price action :-**
1. Take any pair of your choice in forex market & turn on daily timeframe sepration with `Ctrl + Y`.
2. Mark any week in mt5 & move to a 15m timeframe.
3. Checkout for every swing point in the selected sample data & at what time of day it is formed.
4. Check out the direction of which made the most in terms of pips.
5. Check out the characteristics that were synonymous in terms of every single swing point.

### Importance of Higher timeframe support & Resistance levels

Only motive of large institutions is get the entry at good price, which are also an round number around the supprt and resistance levels.

Flow of institutional sposershiop in market which we called as Smart money move can be understood with higher timeframe bias itself.

We never get clarity & move of the market by checking out on intraday timeframes, because structure is being formed at lower timeframes is the directional bias on higher timeframe.

<img src="./assets/sniper/higher-levels.png">

In the above picture you can notice the support & resistance levels drawn on the chart on daily timeframe, when we brakedown this movemnt & levels into intraday timeframes that provides us the optimal entry points in current direction.

<img src="./assets/sniper/entry-points.png">

When we know that on higher timeframe price is approaching to support or resistance levels then we only find out optimal trade entries in that directios only on intraday timeframe.

In tha above chart you can notice when price breakouts previous high levlels big moves appears to the downside, if we brakedown the timings of those moves mostly are in london kill zone & new york kill zones.

**Clarity of movements on higher timeframe :-**

<img src="./assets/sniper/intraday-structure.png">

<img src="./assets/sniper/higer-timeframe-stricture.png">

In the above structure we have marked support & resistance levels which are being respected, and its follwing market structure very well that when resistance is being broken its becoming support & price going for new move from those after retracement.

But if you can notice the upper circuit formed where price has consolidated we are not able to identify it before the time, but if you can notice on higher timeframe there is resistance level exists as mentioned above in second chart, at that price point from where price got reversed as changed the direction of market.

**Excercise for higher timeframe directional bias :-**
1. Mark the recent support & resistance level on daily & 4h timeframe.
2. Notice how price fails to continue the trend as those levels and how does it reacts on those levels.

**Steps to understand higher timeframe directional bias :-**
1. Checkout the trend on higher timeframe such as daily & 4h.
2. Mark the recent support & resistance level on daily & 4h timeframe.
3. Draw he fibs from the higher timeframe swing low to swing high and try to understand price is in continuation phase or retracement phase.
4. And on the smaller timeframe find the setups accordingly.
5. We need to find the setups only in the direction of price's current state of direction.
6. Thats how we get to know directional premise.

### Reaction levels

Reactions levels are the important price levels from higher timeframe which are crucial on lower timefrmae such as 15m etc.

<img src="./assets/sniper/reaction-levels-higher.png">
<img src="./assets/sniper/reaction-points-lower.png">

As you can see above images first chart is daily timeframe chart & below chart is 15m timeframe chart.

We have drawn important levels such as support, resistance, swing points on daily timeframe but those are beautifully getting respected on 15m timeframe, This is how we figure out potential price reaction levels

<!-- ### 10 Year T Note & Yeild Data for direction of currency market.-->

Most of the traders get excited when the any currency pair is volatile, or moving in huge ranges but no one gets excited in the conslidation, but instituional sponsership gets in when the consolidation is happening in any currency pair.

Goal is to take position in consolidating market before everyone gets involved and take benifits of the big rallies which happens after conslidation.

On large range days the open tends to be at the opposite extreme of the daily range oppose to the close.

<img src="./assets/sniper/open-daily-range.png">

You can checkout in the above example notice how much time it happens where open tends to be at the opposite extreme of the daily range, Even if we are able to catch the move then we are still profitable.

`We consider new day from 12:00AM in midnight & 2:000PM according to EST timeframe.` according to instituaional sponsership.

<img src="./assets/sniper/daily-range.png">
<img src="./assets/sniper/sessions-est.png">

You can checkout how price made its daily low around 2AM EST & closed higher around 18:00 EST which is london close as mentioned in the image above for sessoion timings according to EST.

Even if we enter in daily high of down day and close in new york session ending which will create low of day then we can it will lead us to profitablity in our trading journey.

### POWER OF THREE 

There are 3 stages in a trading day in forex market, `Accumulation, Manipulation & Distribution` as mentioned below in buy & sell model for market markers.

<img src="./assets/sniper/buy-model.png">
<img src="./assets/sniper/sell-model.png">

Buy models happens at daily timeframe support levels & sell models occur on daily timeframe resistance levels. We can look into its details by switching to intraday timeframes as well such as 1h & 15m.

**Excercise for power of three :-**

### Market Orders & Institutional Orders

Market price reaches to an key level, where we are expecting reaction on that price level But market have couple of orders near that levels as menitoned below.

<img src="./assets/sniper/resistance-orders.png">

Resistance Ex : Let's consider price is reaching to key resistance levels then it would have existing buy TP orders & stop loss orders above that level who sold on that important level, new buy orders on that level as mentioned above.

<img src="./assets/sniper/support-orders.png">

Support Ex : Let's consider price is reaching to key support levels then it would have TP levels who already sold, new buy orders and SL orders who placed pending buy orders at that important level as mentioned above.

**Market Makers Order Pairing :-**

Market orders gets executed at round numbers around important levels such as 20, 50, 80 & 100's.

Market moves in the direction or pattern around the important levels such that they take out all the retail traders.

**Order pairing at resistance levels :-**

<img src="./assets/sniper/resistance-order-pairing.png">

- When price reacts to `1.3180` level retailers thinks its resistance levels & place their sell orders which is having stop loss around 1.3190.

- Market makers make the second swing to down side to give confirmation to sell orders & to more retailers should get in.

- When retailers gets in with sell orders market makers sweeps thruogh the `1.3180 & 1.3190` which takes out stop losses or previous sell orders & price reacts to `1.3200` levels.

- When price reacts to `1.3200` retailers who waiting for major figure to react sells at the price point & in the next swing price takes through `1.3200` to take out their stop losses.

- When market reached to `1.3220` after sweeping through `1.3200` retailer doesnt takes entry as market went 2 times against them already & break of structure happens for previous swing low.

- When price retraces after breaking the structure after taking retailers out of the market and eating up their stop losses `thats where we should enter into sell trade.`


**Orders Pairing at support levels :-**

<img src="./assets/sniper/support-order-pairing.png">

- When price reacts to `1.3220` level retailers thinks price got reversed from support levels & take the buy trades by placing stop loss below `1.3200`.

- Market makers makes second swing to upside to give confirmation of price reversal from support & to more retailers to get in for buy trade.

- When retailers gets in with buy orders market sweeps down `1.3220` level & takes out stop losses of retailers & reacts to `1.3200` level.

- When price reacts to `1.3200` major level major level traders thinks its the reversal & enters into buy trades but in next swing market sweeps down to `1.3200` level & takes out major level retailers stop losses.

- When price sweeps `1.3200` level & reached to `1.3180` levels retails doesn't enters into trade due to previous as market already went 2 times against them & break of structure happens for previous swing high.

- When the price retraces after breaking the structure after taking all the retailers our of the market eating up their stoplosses `thats where we should enter into buy trade.`

### Directional Bias (SNIPER SERIES)

We give most priority to daily timeframe in directional bias.

We use 2 moving averages on daily timeframe which are `9 & 18`. When the 9 moving average is trading up of 18 moving averages then we will only look for buy trades & when the 9 moving average is trading down of 18 moving averages then we will look for sell trades.

We importantly look for retracements in kill zones for the entry, lets say 9 moving average is trading up of 18 moving averages & we get an retracement to ote on fib level in specific kill zone then its an high probability buy trade and vice versa sell trade will work.

**Moving Average Strategy for swing trading :-**

`ICT says based on the moving averages draw your bullish or bearish trading zones & checkout out the fractals from the Indicators > trend > fracts in MT4. When there is break of structure means previous high broken out in bullish env & retest on it then take the trade. repeat the process until there is break of structure to downside where previous low taken out by the price.`


### Order Block

Institutions doesn't chase the price in the trend, institutions only buys when the price is falling down & sells it when the price is rising up. With the help of order block we can find entries or possible institutions entries which will cause drastic moves to either or upside or to downside.

Order block is the area where institutions accumulates the orders before moving aggresively to upside or downside. Institutions wants to get the entry at the discounted price & moves the price purposely to that level or area to add more quantity to their order before moving agressively.

Price retraces to that order block before moving more higher or before giving bigger move this is the charecteristics of order block. When the order block collapses with `fibonacci OTE zone (62, 70.5 or 79)` then it have more higher probabilities to be an reversal in the ongoing direction.

<img src="./assets/sniper/order-block.png">
<img src="./assets/sniper/order-block-2.png">

**How to find valid order block :-**

- There should be trend going on either upside or downside on higher timeframe, not the consolidation to find the valid order block.

- Price should be at important support or resistance level of higher timeframe charts such as 1h, 4h or daily timeframe.

- Price should give break of structure to previous swing's high (In terms of uptrend directional premise) and to previous swing's low (In terms of downtrend directional premise) with the help of 9 & 18 moving averages.

- `Area of Inverse directional Candle before the aggresive move to any side which caused break of structure is an order block.` 

**Optimal Trade Entry (Strategy) with order block :-**

<img src="./assets/sniper/orderblock-ote.png">
<img src="./assets/sniper/orderblock-ote2.png">

- Most important things are price should be in trend either uptrend or downtrend according to higher timeframe directional bias with the help of 9 & 18 moving averages.

- Price should be at important support or resistance level of higher timeframe charts such as 1h, 4h or on daily timeframe.

- Mark the area of inverse directional candle before an aggresive move to any side which caused break of structure of previous swings high(Uptrend) or swing low(downtrend).

- Mark the fibonacci levels from swing low & new swing high(uptrend) or low(downtrend) which caused break of structure.

- If order block levels follows the OTE setup in `fibonacci OTE zone (62, 70.5 or 79)` then take the entry keeping 20-30 pips stoploss & targetting previous swings high(uptrend) or low(downtrend).
