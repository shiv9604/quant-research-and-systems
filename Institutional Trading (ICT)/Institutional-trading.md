# Institutional Trading

Institutional trading is the study of SMART MONEY CONCEPTS & the way of trading in the instituional way.

## ICT WENT SERIES
### Swing Points

Swing points are the points where we can get to know the where the swing has ended in uptrend or downtrend.

**Swing High :-**

In swing high middle 3 candles setup in which middle candle is higher one, and lower high on left & lower high on right candle to it as mentioned below.

<img src="./assets/went/swing-high.png" alt="">

**Swing Low :-**

In swing low middle candle setup in which middle candle is lower candle, and higher low on left & higher low on right candles to it.

<img src="./assets/went/swing-low.png" alt="">

**Chart Analysis :-**

Draw horizontal lines of the range of swing low & swing high pattern, dont missout any swing high's & lows' it will lead to market reversal which would not be planned by you.

**Rules :-**

- If any levels are matching nearby avoid remarking that level with tiny difference.

- If any new swing high & low forms within the marked range then we dont need to redraw again because we are considering major swing high & low points. the newly swing high & low formed within the range could be considered as secondary points.

<img src="./assets/went/swing-points-analysis.png" alt="">

**Importance :-**

There is importance of open, high, low & close of 3 of the candles in swing high & swing low pattern, those are the important & sensitive price levels to which price reacts & respects.

### Excercise 1

**Analysis :-**

- Mark the daily & weekly swing low's & high's on the chart where support & resistance levels are overlapping.

- Turn on daily & weekly time sepration on the chart.

**Actions :-**

- Buy on daily & weekly lows with 1:1 ratio of 20 pips.  
  
- Sell on daily & weekly highs with 1:1 ratio of 20 pips.

This excersice builds the acceptance of looses & builds the discipling required for waiting for our setups.

Analyze the trades & checkout how much profit & loss you have booked for the month.

### Market Structure

Before studying market structure we need to have our framework for our analysis, Which depends on your trading style.

We get overwhelmed when we analyze the things on multiple time frames but according to our trading style we should analyze the market structure by using 3 timeframes only as mentioned below.

<img src="./assets/went/timeframes.png" alt="">

**Purpose of multiple-timeframes :-**

- **Bigger timeframe : -** 
    
  We use bigger timeframes to analyze the market direction & moves.

- **Medium timeframe :-** 
  
  We use Medium timeframe to manage our trade like adjusting stoplosses etc.

- **Smaller timeframe :-** 
  
  We use smaller timeframe for our entries & checking out the early reversal signals through it & booking our profits accordingly.

**Uptrend Market Structure :-**

<img src="./assets/went/uptrend.png">

We look for market strucuture we checkout on bigger timeframe in our framework, and Whenever is pricing moving up it makes consolidation to grab some more buy orders & it continues its strucutre to upwards as mentioned above.

The market structure will be respected to major supply zone on bigger timeframe, and when it breaks previous 2 swing low's it does mean price got reversed.

**Downtrend Market Structure :-**

<img src="./assets/went/downtrend.png">

We look for market strucuture we checkout on bigger timeframe in our framework, and Whenever is pricing moving down it makes consolidation to grab some more sell orders & it continues its strucutre to downwards as mentioned above.

The market structure will be respected to major demand zone on bigger timeframe, and when it breaks previous 2 swing high's it does mean price got reversed.

**Break of structure :-**

<img src="./assets/went/break-of-structure.png">

When the price reached some demand zone & some important levels & price reverses and break the previous swing low then its confirmation of market versal.

The broken down level of previous `swing low (Uptrend reversal)` & `swing high (Downtrend reversal)` acts as retracement level.

**Long term High/Low :-**

<img src="./assets/went/long-term-high-low.png">

When a High has lower high's on both of side & even lower high's of long swing then its an long term high.

When a low has higher low on both of the side & even higher lows of long swings then its long term low.


**Kill Zone and Key S & R Level :-**

<img src="./assets/went/killzone.png">
When you identify the price action on bigger timeframe of your framework, You dont enter into trade at any point.

You checkout your bigger timeframe bias what your pricing is telling, either bu llish or bearish. And you wait for the kill zone at the key support & resistance levels and then you can take entry with market or pending orders.

**Market Structure Strategy :-**

- Find high & low on the bigger timeframes(Monthly) of your setup & calibrate your high's & low's on weekly chart.

- Mark the range where the market is heading on bigger timeframe(Monthly) & colour it according to buy or sell.

- From the low's wait for break of structure & find out the retracement from `low to newer high (In terms of Uptrend directional bias)` & `High to newer low (In terms of Downtrend directional bias)`

- Wait for price to retrace in your golden zone & wait for reversal signs.

- Take the trades only in long term directional bias direction (Long term trend).

- Continue to the setup of finding the retracement from `long term low (In terms of Uptrend directional bias)` & `long term high (In terms of Downtrend directional bias)` to structured braked `Newer High (In terms of Uptrend directional bias)` & `Newer Low (In terms of Downtrend directional bias)` to grab entries at fibbonacci golden zone & set the targets previous swing levels.

### Support & Resistance

Trading Horizontal Support & Resistance levels doesnt tells us exactly buy to sell but moreon it tells us what levels price can react.

All the indicators are lagging which means they are indicating the signals behind the price thats why in the backtesting it performs well but in the live market it gives us late signals which will lead us to losses.

We should not look for support & resistance levels around the patterns we are looking for instead we should wait for price to reach at those important levels & then we should look for patterns or any other indications which tells us the reversal or continuation of the trend.

<img src="./assets/went/support-resistance.png">

**What Support Resistance tells us :-**

**Support :-**

  Support identifies an area where there buyers going to overwhelm the sellers & waiting for the buy opportunity on that perticular levels.

  Sometimes market makers moves the markets below the support levels as well to collect the pending orders or hit the stoplosses of retail traders & to fill their huge orders by existing retail traders out there.

**Resistance :-**

  Resistance indentifies an area where sellers going to overwhelm the buyers & they were waiting for the sell opportunity on that perticular levels.

  Sometomes market makers moves the market above the resistance levels as well to collect the pending orders or to hit stoplosses of retail traders so they will get exited out of trade & to fill their huge orders.


**Strength of the trend & levels :-**

<img src="./assets/went/sr-strength.png">

When price breaks resistance levels frequently & respects support levels then its very good indication of bullish behaviour.

When the price breaks support levels & respects resistance levels then its very good indication of bearish behaviour.

The more times support & resistance levels respected then its more valid levels.

**Types of Support & Resistance Levels :-**

<img src="./assets/went/sr-types.png">

1. **Natural S&R Levels :-**
   
   We have Natural S&R Levels like in the hirarchyfrom session, daily, highly, weekly, monthly, quaterly, & 12 Month.

   - **12 Month High's Low's :-**

    <img src="./assets/went/sr-yearly.png">

    12 Month High's Low's dont makes setup whole lot but we need to keep a note of yearly high's & low's for longer term directional bias.
  
  - **Quaterly High's Low's :-**

    <img src="./assets/went/sr-quaterly.png">

    Quaterly high's & low's are most important ones for long term swing trades & highly respected as well. We need to keep note of Quaterly high's & low's in our swing trades as its plays very important roles in it.

  - **Monthly High's Low's :-**

    <img src="./assets/went/sr-monthly.png">  

    Multiple opportunities given with the help of monthly high's & low's. We find a lot of setup for swing trades with the help of monthly high's & lows which will gives great returns even without spending a lot of time in front of screen.

  - **Weekly High's Low's :-**

    <img src="./assets/went/sr-weekly.png">

    Weekly high's low's are the levels we look frequently in our swing trades as price respects those levels obidiently. We can catch great moves with the help of weekly high's low's without spending much of time in front of screen.

  - **Daily High's Low's :-**
  
    <img src="./assets/went/sr-daily.png">

    We look for minimum of 3 days of data while considering daily high's low's which gives us the good key levels for intraday trading.

  - **Asian High's & Low's :-**

    <img src="./assets/went/sr-asian.png">

    Asian session high's & low's are very important levels for intraday trading & Scalping.

    On this levels price reacts very well and the asian session high's & low's are specially usefull for London & New York session traders.

    Asian session high's & low's are formed in between `6:30AM to 2:30PM` as per Indian Standard Time.


  - **London session High's & Low's :-**
  
    <img src="./assets/went/sr-london.png">

    London session high's and low's are very influential for New york session traders, There are lot of opportunities forms within london sessions.

    London session high's and low's are formed in between `12:30PM to 8:30PM` as per Indian Standard time.
  
  - **New York session High's & Low's :-**

    <img src="./assets/went/sr-newyork.png">

    New York session high's & low's are important for New day upcoming Asian session. Asian sessions requires refrences high's & low's for previous New York session & London session.

    New York session high's & low's are formed in between `5:30PM to 2:30AM` as per Indian Standard Time.

`Note :- We look for at least 2 previous sessions high's & low's while trading in any kind of session. When we are looking as per bigger timeframe we should look for atleast 2 greater high's & low's In Example if we are looking on daily chart we should look for weekly & monthly high's low's.`
  
 
2. **Implied S&R Levels :-**

  <img src="./assets/went/sr-implied.png"> 

   We have Implied S&R Levels like in the hirarchyfrom session like fibonacci retracements, fibonacci extensions, Pivot points on intrdaday charts like 5m or 15m etc.
  
  When Natural S&R levels & Implied S&R Levels are collapsing or near around each other then its high probability S&R levels which would be respected most of the times.  


**Institutional Price Levels :-**

<img src="./assets/went/sr-institutional.png">

  Institutional Price Levels are not odd number price levels in the market, they are round number levels with 100-300 pips of range like in terms of GBPUSD it would be as mentioned above in the picture.

  They use `.20`, `.50` and `.80` levles for managing the trades and their exits.

  Thats why our price sometimes penetrates through our support & resistance levels on odd price points, it goes till these institutions levels then it reverses or reacts.


### How Commercials Trade

<img src="./assets/went/commercials-trade.png">

Commercials trade in different way, they are long term trader and if they are getting the things at less price they buy, and buy and more buy untill market reaches to important support level.

When the trends reverses then they start selling in the market due to which the retracements forms in ongoing trend due to their profit booking.

**COT Analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/went/cot.png">

COT Chart is the combined chart of commercial, institutional & retail traders Where it explains the their net buying positions range & net Selling position range with actual data of their transactions.

**How to Read Chart :-**

**Thicker Line :-**

  Thicker line represents the commercial traders & their positions with above and below the 0 level.

**Medium Line :-**

  Medium line represents the financial institutions & their positions with above and below the 0 levels.

**Thinner Line :-**

  Thinner line represents the retail traders & their positions with above and below the 0 levels.

Here we only do care about the commercial traders, We know that commercial traders buy when the market is falling so they get the contracts at better prices & they sell when contract prices rises to book their profits.

**Commercial COT :-**

<img src="./assets/went/cot-commercials.png">

<img src="./assets/went/cot-insider.png">

<img src="./assets/went/cot-graphical.png">

In the above chart we can see 12 Month extreme Net long & 12 months extreme net short where posisible market reversal happens.

We dont look for only this COT data to make our decision but we combine support & resistance along with it where we get to know price reached at support level & commercial traders also done with buying.

When the price reverses & commercials start booking profits market retraces in the ongoing trend and thats where we exactly look for sniper entries.

When we notice the short downtrend of commercial orders at point 2 at may month it doesnt means market got reversed but the smaller corrections is happening for collecting for more buy order.

At the point 5 and in the month of september it means commercials done with their buying & when their buying trend is loosing it strength and you can notice when the cot chart goes down to 0 then its huge moment comes in and thats when we put out most our leaverage in. `We look for this kind of opportunities in the market as ict traders.`

**COT Strategy :-**

<img src="./assets/went/oct-trade.png">

1. Trade in the direction of most recent 12 months commitment of traders.

2. Wait for price to form intermidiate term swings retracements and then take entry.
   
3. Use OTE (Optimal Trade Entry) pattern to enter into trade with the help of fibonacci.

4. Take only Buy positions when COT reaches fresh 12 months and or 4 year extremes on commercial net short positions.

5. Take only Sell positions when COT reaches fresh 12 months and or 4 year extremes on commercial net long positions.

6. Combine retracement with support & resistance in the direction of COT guides.

### Weekly High & Low's Importance

<img src="./assets/went/weekly-high-low.png">

Weekly high & low's are the important levels for swing trades with 15m chartsEven simply if you buy at weekly low & sell at weekly high then still you would be profitable.

Weekly High's form in bearish environments in tuesday's or wednsday's london session opening.

Weekly Low's form in bullish enviornments in tuesday's or wednsday's london session opening.

### ICT Kill Zones

ICT kill zones are the time zones from 24 hours of forex markets where highest probabilities trade setup forms.

There are 4 types of kill zones introduced by ICT which are as followed.

**Types of Kill Zones :-**

- **Asian Kill Zone :-**

  `EST - 8pm TO 12am` `IST - 6:30am - 10:30am` is the Asian kill zone is high volatility zone for AUD, NZD & JPY pairs are ideal to trade. According to volatility we can trade `AUD/JPY & NZD/JPY` in Asian kill zone.

  Its charecteristics is the consolidation phase of market & major currency paris which leads to potential trend continuation or reversal.

- **London Open Kill Zone :-**
  
  `EST - 2am TO 5am` `IST - 12:30pm - 3:30pm` is the London Open kill zone is volatility zone for `EUR/USD & GBP/USD` pairs. 

  Its main charecteristics is to create low of the day in bullish market & high of the day in bearish market.

- **New York Kill Zone :-**
  
  `EST - 7am TO 10am` `IST - 5:30pm - 8:30pm` is the New York Kill zone is volatility zone for major pairs coupled with USD like `USD/CHF, USD/CAD, USD/JPY, XAU/USD & XAG/USD` etc.

  Its main charecteristics is either the continuation of london move or complete reversal of it.

- **London Close Kill Zone :-**

  `EST - 10am to 12pm` `IST - 8:30pm - 10:30pm` is the London close kill zone is volatility zone for EUR, GBP, USD coupled pairs.

  Its main charecteristics is to retracement of daily high's or low's & its major area for the change in direction of weekly & daily trend.


### USD Index Corelation with Commodity, Stocks & Currencies

USD Index indirectly indicates the direction of Forex Market such as comodity, stocks & currencies direction if analyzed on higher time frame like 1d & 4h.

When the USD index is up then eveverything else will goes down which is called as `RISK OFF` & when the USD index goes down then everything else will go up and its called as `RISK ON`.

Whenever we start for analysis for forex we should start with USD index on higher timeframe & its swing direction.

<img src="./assets/went/usdindex-relation.png">

You can checkout the EUR/USD Movement directly related to usd index, Both are moving in identical manner but in reverse order.

Nearly Exact respected currencies with respect to USD INDEX are as mentioend below.

- EUR/USD
- GBP/USD
- XAU/USD
- XAG/USD
- USD/CHF

**London Kill Zone Strategy with USD index :-**
- Check out the USD Index move & analyze the market move for your currency pair for today either up day or down day.
- Mark the London open line or london kill zone on chart to check where it breaks fake outs previous swing level.
- Mark the fibs for the high & low of the new trading day swing
- Find the `day high in terms of downtrend day` and `day low in terms of uptrend day`  with the Fibonacci retracement in golden zone & fake out of the previous swing `high in terms of down day` & `low (in terms of up day)`.
- Keep the stop loss of 30 pips above your founded low & high because we are already keeping 1/3 or stop loss of the daily average range of 100 pips even at its highest point.
- Take `SELL trade in terms of down day` and `BUY trade in terms of up day`.
  
We can use 9 and 18 moving average crossovers as well to check long term directional bias & we can mark the zone with appropriate color which will indicate sell directions which we are going to take.

## ICT FOREX SCOUT SNIPER SERIES

### Sniper setups trades classfication

Sniper setups trades are the trades we derive in advance already and we plan everything before trade like entry points, stop loss levels & even take profit levels.

Sniper trade setups can be classified as mainly the setups with advance before time analysis and limit orders for the trade with SL, TP and entry point.

**Factors to be considered while preparing sniper setups :-**
1. Precision Point Entry Prices - Applicable for use of Limit Order.
2. Utilization of specific time of day critiria.
3. Advance knowledge of target prices for positive exit points.
4. Employement of strict risk management protocols.
5. Calm & disciplinary trading without emotions and impatience.

### Swing Points

Swing points are the High's & low's points sourrounded with `Low's having higher 2 high's on both side` & `high's having 2 lower low's on both side` are called as swing points.

We can use the indicator as well for the same in MT5 for it. Insert > Indicators > Bill Williams > Fractals.

<img src="./assets/sniper/swing-points.png">

**Excercise with swing points to understand price action :-**
1. Take any pair of your choice in forex market & turn on daily timeframe sepration with `Ctrl + Y`.
2. Mark any week in mt5 & move to a 15m timeframe.
3. Checkout for every swing point in the selected sample data & at what time of day it is formed.
4. Check out the direction of which made the most in terms of pips.
5. Check out the characteristics that were synonymous in terms of every single swing point.

### Importance of Higher timeframe support & Resistance levels

Only motive of large institutions is get the entry at good price, which are also an round number around the supprt and resistance levels.

Flow of institutional sposershiop in market which we called as Smart money move can be understood with higher timeframe bias itself.

We never get clarity & move of the market by checking out on intraday timeframes, because structure is being formed at lower timeframes is the directional bias on higher timeframe.

<img src="./assets/sniper/higher-levels.png">

In the above picture you can notice the support & resistance levels drawn on the chart on daily timeframe, when we brakedown this movemnt & levels into intraday timeframes that provides us the optimal entry points in current direction.

<img src="./assets/sniper/entry-points.png">

When we know that on higher timeframe price is approaching to support or resistance levels then we only find out optimal trade entries in that directios only on intraday timeframe.

In tha above chart you can notice when price breakouts previous high levlels big moves appears to the downside, if we brakedown the timings of those moves mostly are in london kill zone & new york kill zones.

**Clarity of movements on higher timeframe :-**

<img src="./assets/sniper/intraday-structure.png">

<img src="./assets/sniper/higer-timeframe-stricture.png">

In the above structure we have marked support & resistance levels which are being respected, and its follwing market structure very well that when resistance is being broken its becoming support & price going for new move from those after retracement.

But if you can notice the upper circuit formed where price has consolidated we are not able to identify it before the time, but if you can notice on higher timeframe there is resistance level exists as mentioned above in second chart, at that price point from where price got reversed as changed the direction of market.

**Excercise for higher timeframe directional bias :-**
1. Mark the recent support & resistance level on daily & 4h timeframe.
2. Notice how price fails to continue the trend as those levels and how does it reacts on those levels.

**Steps to understand higher timeframe directional bias :-**
1. Checkout the trend on higher timeframe such as daily & 4h.
2. Mark the recent support & resistance level on daily & 4h timeframe.
3. Draw he fibs from the higher timeframe swing low to swing high and try to understand price is in continuation phase or retracement phase.
4. And on the smaller timeframe find the setups accordingly.
5. We need to find the setups only in the direction of price's current state of direction.
6. Thats how we get to know directional premise.

### Reaction levels

Reactions levels are the important price levels from higher timeframe which are crucial on lower timefrmae such as 15m etc.

<img src="./assets/sniper/reaction-levels-higher.png">
<img src="./assets/sniper/reaction-points-lower.png">

As you can see above images first chart is daily timeframe chart & below chart is 15m timeframe chart.

We have drawn important levels such as support, resistance, swing points on daily timeframe but those are beautifully getting respected on 15m timeframe, This is how we figure out potential price reaction levels

<!-- ### 10 Year T Note & Yeild Data for direction of currency market.-->

Most of the traders get excited when the any currency pair is volatile, or moving in huge ranges but no one gets excited in the conslidation, but instituional sponsership gets in when the consolidation is happening in any currency pair.

Goal is to take position in consolidating market before everyone gets involved and take benifits of the big rallies which happens after conslidation.

On large range days the open tends to be at the opposite extreme of the daily range oppose to the close.

<img src="./assets/sniper/open-daily-range.png">

You can checkout in the above example notice how much time it happens where open tends to be at the opposite extreme of the daily range, Even if we are able to catch the move then we are still profitable.

`We consider new day from 12:00AM in midnight & 2:000PM according to EST timeframe.` according to instituaional sponsership.

<img src="./assets/sniper/daily-range.png">
<img src="./assets/sniper/sessions-est.png">

You can checkout how price made its daily low around 2AM EST & closed higher around 18:00 EST which is london close as mentioned in the image above for sessoion timings according to EST.

Even if we enter in daily high of down day and close in new york session ending which will create low of day then we can it will lead us to profitablity in our trading journey.

### POWER OF THREE 

There are 3 stages in a trading day in forex market, `Accumulation, Manipulation & Distribution` as mentioned below in buy & sell model for market markers.

<img src="./assets/sniper/buy-model.png">
<img src="./assets/sniper/sell-model.png">

Buy models happens at daily timeframe support levels & sell models occur on daily timeframe resistance levels. We can look into its details by switching to intraday timeframes as well such as 1h & 15m.

**Excercise for power of three :-**

### Market Orders & Institutional Orders

Market price reaches to an key level, where we are expecting reaction on that price level But market have couple of orders near that levels as menitoned below.

<img src="./assets/sniper/resistance-orders.png">

Resistance Ex : Let's consider price is reaching to key resistance levels then it would have existing buy TP orders & stop loss orders above that level who sold on that important level, new buy orders on that level as mentioned above.

<img src="./assets/sniper/support-orders.png">

Support Ex : Let's consider price is reaching to key support levels then it would have TP levels who already sold, new buy orders and SL orders who placed pending buy orders at that important level as mentioned above.

**Market Makers Order Pairing :-**

Market orders gets executed at round numbers around important levels such as 20, 50, 80 & 100's.

Market moves in the direction or pattern around the important levels such that they take out all the retail traders.

**Order pairing at resistance levels :-**

<img src="./assets/sniper/resistance-order-pairing.png">

- When price reacts to `1.3180` level retailers thinks its resistance levels & place their sell orders which is having stop loss around 1.3190.

- Market makers make the second swing to down side to give confirmation to sell orders & to more retailers should get in.

- When retailers gets in with sell orders market makers sweeps thruogh the `1.3180 & 1.3190` which takes out stop losses or previous sell orders & price reacts to `1.3200` levels.

- When price reacts to `1.3200` retailers who waiting for major figure to react sells at the price point & in the next swing price takes through `1.3200` to take out their stop losses.

- When market reached to `1.3220` after sweeping through `1.3200` retailer doesnt takes entry as market went 2 times against them already & break of structure happens for previous swing low.

- When price retraces after breaking the structure after taking retailers out of the market and eating up their stop losses `thats where we should enter into sell trade.`


**Orders Pairing at support levels :-**

<img src="./assets/sniper/support-order-pairing.png">

- When price reacts to `1.3220` level retailers thinks price got reversed from support levels & take the buy trades by placing stop loss below `1.3200`.

- Market makers makes second swing to upside to give confirmation of price reversal from support & to more retailers to get in for buy trade.

- When retailers gets in with buy orders market sweeps down `1.3220` level & takes out stop losses of retailers & reacts to `1.3200` level.

- When price reacts to `1.3200` major level major level traders thinks its the reversal & enters into buy trades but in next swing market sweeps down to `1.3200` level & takes out major level retailers stop losses.

- When price sweeps `1.3200` level & reached to `1.3180` levels retails doesn't enters into trade due to previous as market already went 2 times against them & break of structure happens for previous swing high.

- When the price retraces after breaking the structure after taking all the retailers our of the market eating up their stoplosses `thats where we should enter into buy trade.`

### Directional Bias (SNIPER SERIES)

We give most priority to daily timeframe in directional bias.

We use 2 moving averages on daily timeframe which are `9 & 18`. When the 9 moving average is trading up of 18 moving averages then we will only look for buy trades & when the 9 moving average is trading down of 18 moving averages then we will look for sell trades.

We importantly look for retracements in kill zones for the entry, lets say 9 moving average is trading up of 18 moving averages & we get an retracement to ote on fib level in specific kill zone then its an high probability buy trade and vice versa sell trade will work.

**Moving Average Strategy for swing trading :-**

`ICT says based on the moving averages draw your bullish or bearish trading zones & checkout out the fractals from the Indicators > trend > fracts in MT4. When there is break of structure means previous high broken out in bullish env & retest on it then take the trade. repeat the process until there is break of structure to downside where previous low taken out by the price.`


### Order Block

Institutions doesn't chase the price in the trend, institutions only buys when the price is falling down & sells it when the price is rising up. With the help of order block we can find entries or possible institutions entries which will cause drastic moves to either or upside or to downside.

Order block is the area where institutions accumulates the orders before moving aggresively to upside or downside. Institutions wants to get the entry at the discounted price & moves the price purposely to that level or area to add more quantity to their order before moving agressively.

Price retraces to that order block before moving more higher or before giving bigger move this is the charecteristics of order block. When the order block collapses with `fibonacci OTE zone (62, 70.5 or 79)` then it have more higher probabilities to be an reversal in the ongoing direction.

<img src="./assets/sniper/order-block.png">
<img src="./assets/sniper/order-block-2.png">

**How to find valid order block :-**

- There should be trend going on either upside or downside on higher timeframe, not the consolidation to find the valid order block.

- Price should be at important support or resistance level of higher timeframe charts such as 1h, 4h or daily timeframe.

- Price should give break of structure to previous swing's high (In terms of uptrend directional premise) and to previous swing's low (In terms of downtrend directional premise) with the help of 9 & 18 moving averages.

- `Area of Inverse directional Candle before the aggresive move to any side which caused break of structure is an order block.` 

**Optimal Trade Entry (Strategy) with order block :-**

<img src="./assets/sniper/orderblock-ote.png">
<img src="./assets/sniper/orderblock-ote2.png">

- Most important things are price should be in trend either uptrend or downtrend according to higher timeframe directional bias with the help of 9 & 18 moving averages.

- Price should be at important support or resistance level of higher timeframe charts such as 1h, 4h or on daily timeframe.

- Mark the area of inverse directional candle before an aggresive move to any side which caused break of structure of previous swings high(Uptrend) or swing low(downtrend).

- Mark the fibonacci levels from swing low & new swing high(uptrend) or low(downtrend) which caused break of structure. (Checkout for the important price level to draw fibs such as 00, 20, 50, 80)'s.

- If order block levels follows the OTE setup in `fibonacci OTE zone (62, 70.5 or 79)` then take the entry keeping 20-30 pips stoploss & targetting previous swings high(uptrend) or low(downtrend).

### ICT Range Finding

Sometimes our analysis is right, trade goes our way but our take profit levels doen't hit & price reverses the direction & winning trade turns into lossing trade.

Thats because we knew the entry but not the apppropriate exit or the price range for swing direction of our trade.

Range finding is mostly used for finding the range to book the profit in the direction of your trade, it indicates direction of our trade will reach to what price levels before reversal against our direction of our trade.

<img src="./assets/sniper/range-finding.png">
<img src="./assets/sniper/range-finding2.png">

Above mentioned image shows that when price breaks out or breaks down some swing, it goes downs by the broken down swing high range.

ie. first swings high range is the distance price goes down that much when its broken down its low, price moves down the same amount as much its high was.

It is not necessary that price will got to same amount of `breakout swings low(in terms of breakout)` or `breakdown swings high(in terms of breakdown)` always but there is very high probability that it will goes up to `1.27% & 1.62%` of that range. We can figure out its 1.27% & 1.62 levels by reversing the fibonacci levels such as `high to low (uptrend)` & `low to high(downtrend)`.


<img src="./assets/sniper/bullish-range.png">

**How to get exit points with fibs :-**

**Bullish Range :-**

<img src="./assets/sniper/bullish-range.png">

In the above example we have figured out the entry when price retraced in order block & consider that we have took the entry already.

Draw fibs from retracement swing high to retracement swing low to figure out the tp levels on fibs such as `1.27 & 1.62`. When price reaches to 1.27 we can shift our stoploss to `1.27` so we can secure the profit & we can wait for price to hit the next target for `1.62` & same process to do furhter till `2.00`.

**Bearish Range :-**

<img src="./assets/sniper/bearish-range.png">

In the above example we have figured out the entry when price retraced in order block & consider that we have took the entry already.

Draw fibs from retracement swing low to retracement swing high to figure out the tp levels on fibs such as `1.27 & 1.62`. When price reaches to `1.27` we can shift our stoploss to `1.27` so we can secure the profit & we can wait for price to hit the next target for `1.62` & same process to do further till `2.00`.

### Risk Management

When we are beginner in the trading we should focus on protecting our capital rather than profits. Once we are able to protect our capital we will automatically lead to profitability.

There is an market standard of `2%` risk per trade but as an beginner trader we should keep `1% risk` per trade, even the most professional traders or even ict himself keep the risk per trade is upto `3%` of his equity.

3% per trade is the highest risk in terms of trading when you are an professional forex trader with years of experience.

We should keep `30pips of initial stoploss` or we should keep the stoploos below 2 swing high's(downtrend) & low's(uptrend) levels & keep the stoploss away from that levels by 10-15 pips.

15m timeframes gives clarity of whole week prespective, focus on tuesday's or wednesday's london for weekly high(downtrend) & weekly low(uptrend).

**Time Stops :-**

Time stops are the amount of time we should wait before cutting any trade which is not going in our direction. below mentioned waiting time limits before collapsing the trades when it goes against you.

- **Daily Setup :-** `3 Days`

- **4hr setup :-** `1 day`

- **1hr chart :-** `2 session tops.`


**Triggerting Stoploss :-**

Never rush to trigger the stop to breakeven.

When price starts to move in your way cut it by 30%, When price reached to first target reduce it even more 30% & when market reached to tp2 then move to breakeven.

When another break of structure happens on important level, we shift our stoploss to recent 2 swings low.

**Target Expectations :-**

In the intraday scalping, when trade will be in your favor & it should be minimum of `15-20 pips` in intraday, `60-70 pips` in weekly range.

Do not take the trade if your setup does not satisfy your intraday or weekly target expectations.


**InSync trades & OutSync trades :-**

In Sync trade are the trades which are in sync with your higher timeframe such as `daily ,4h timeframes` directional bias & outsync is your trades based on intraday timeframes such as `1hr, 15m, 5m timeframes`.

ICT suggests always trade in sync with higher timeframes, you can make some pips or profits by trading against the market buttt we are looking for bigger moves & consistant profitablity for which we will need to in sync with higher timeframes.

### ICT Split Gains Ratio

Its important to take out some money out of the trade when its going in your direction. Set your targets in 2-3 levels & book your profits in slots, when price hits to tp1, tp2 & tp3 accordingly.

We take out the profits out of trades according to the ratios mentioned in the above image.

**Intermediate Term Ratios :-**
<img src="./assets/sniper/split-gains-intermediate.png">

- **50-50 :-** We setup only 2 target levels in which we book profit by `50%` on each level.


**Intraday Ratios :-**
<img src="./assets/sniper/split-gains-intraday.png">

- **50-50 :-** When we are scalping then we setup 2 target levels in which we book `50%` on each tp level.

- **Watch your six :-** If you are not confirmed on your trade then reduce your position by `50%`.


### Summary of Sniper Series

<img src="./assets/sniper/sniper-summary.png">

We have learned that so far in sniper series is that directional moves in the market happens when `smart money (Large institutions & Banks) gets into market` and we as a trader not trying to predict the market direction, instead we are spoting the traces of entry of smart money & follow with them to get some small profits.

We can identify the direction of smart money with higher timeframe charts & smart money operates in weekly range, when they want to enter into market they moves the price downward to buy at discounted price & they move market upwards to sell their large number of orders.

Sudden & explosive moves happens when stops at important levels are blown out, when stops trigger of retail traders, orders get released into market so smart money can grab maximum of the orders consumed by the retailers. When orders are accumulated at some important levels then explosive moves comes into market due to smart money's entry in it.

We use fibonacci & order blocks to find the retracements in explosive moves & to continue with instituional rally. we can place the stops of 30 pips standard & we can trail the stops to below 10-15 pips below low of previous 2 swings. We use fibonacci also for target setting with their levels such as `1, 1.27,1.62 & 2`.

We focus on new york & london sessions which both have their special charecteristics & daily high's in downtrend market & daily low's in uptrend market occurs into london kill zone & new york eiter continues the rally or price gets reversed in it.

We mostly focus on swing trading as weekly setups with the help of higher timeframes such as `4h & daily` as prices have weekly directions where we can get same amount of profits rahter than looking for daily setups.

**Daily Timeframe Checklist :-**

<img src="./assets/sniper/daily-timeframe-checklist.png">

- The direction of 10 years yeild data, market moves in that direction.
- Obvious key support & resitance levels with 2-3 years of data either on daily or weekly timeframes.
- Current market structure, Long-term or Intermediate term or maybe long term.
- Order flow where instituions trading to upside or downside.
- EMA setup of 9 & 18 ema.
- Swing highs & lows with minimum 1 candles on each side.
- Potential order blocks on daily or 4h or 1h timeframe.
- previous 3 daily candles high, low open & close levels are sensitive.

**4h Timeframe Checklist :-**

<img src="./assets/sniper/4h-timeframe-checklist.png">

- Daily timeframe directional bias.
- Only look for buy trades if daily bias in buy model
- Only look for sell trades if daily bias in sell model
- Order blocks retracements with fibonacci confirmations by keeping daily bias in mind.
- Keep eye on daily timeframe reaction levels.
- 4h Timeframe analysis will be carries forward to 1hr timeframe.

**1h Timeframe Checklist :-**

<img src="./assets/sniper/1h-timeframe-checklist.png">

- daily bias we keep in mind for analysis of 1h chart.
- Order blocks on 4h timeframe & daily timeframe should be focused first.
- View weekly range on 1h timeframe to figure out the swing points.
- Weekly high's & low's forms in mon-wed in the week.
- We are not lokking for daily trades, we are looking for one solid setup for week.
- 1h timeframe analysis will carry forward to 15 & 5m timeframe.

**15m & 5m timeframe Checklist :-**

- Daily bias should be kept in mind.
- Mark day seprator to have idea about the whole week.
- Note asian range high & low to refer in london sessions to important price points.
- Daily high's & low's forms after sharp fake moves in opposite directoins which is called as juda's swings.
- spot OTE setups with combination of time, price & analysis breakdown from higher timeframe to lower timeframe.
- Use fibs to fine tune order blocks & ote retracements.
- Dont trade new york open if the price is trading on important level because its charistcis to have reversals in new york sessions.
- Dont rush the entry & wait patiently for setups to be formed.
- Focus 1hr timeframe levels for profit booking with atleast 1:3 & higher.


`Note :- Stay Patient, Slow & Steady wins the race!!!`

## ICT Precision Trading Concept Series

### Weekly Orderblock & Order Flow

Order blocks which are found on weekly-chart overlooked by new traders but with those  orderblocks we can plan low risk-high probability trade.

Low-risk & High probability setups derived from higher time frame perspectives. The large institutions and banks are basing the majority of their trades from these charts.

There is lot of more fundamental & major news required to change the direction in the weekly charts.

We use 9 EMA & 18 EMA to identify the directional bias on weekly timeframe, when the 9 EMA is trading above the 18 EMA & the gap is opening widely then its the bullish directional bias & bullish order flow. Same vice versa for the when 9 EMA is trading below the 18 EMA & opening wide gap then its bearish directional bias & bearish order flow.

We avoid long wicked candles for orderblock, there should be enough body to the candle to forma an orderblock.

<img src="./assets/precison_trading/weekly-orderblock.png">

Even if our orderblocks got taken out you can checkout the confluence of important support & resistance level & we need to keep in mind that price heads towards where liquidity resides not our line or orderblopck or support level exists. So we should accept it & lookout for next opportunities.

USD/CHF is the king of volatility pair but it trades in most of the ranges, we can find multiple setups in USDCHF wiht the help of orderblocks strategy.

If the price retraces below than 79% retracement level & not entered into orderblock yet then we should avoid that retracemnt as its an invalid retracement level which is already retraced around `79%` but still not reached orderblock yet.

We can trade the each & every range in the market no matter what is the long term directional bias is but the only thing we need to know that it increased the trade opportunities as well as our loosing trades as well. So its always better to trade into the directional of higher timeframe directional bias.


## Market Maker Primer Series

### Liquidity Pools

Before understanding liquidity we should know that `how the market moves?` normally market moves towards the liquidity, where the stoploss order resides of retail traders to take them out & take their huge contracts get executed after taken out the retailers who holding the contracts.

In the traditional methods or in the books it teaches us the retail patterns such as double tops or double bottom where we should take buy trade & sell trade at double top etc.

But the market looking the support resistance in the different ways. From retail prespective we see the levels as support & resistance levels but institutions look those levels for liquidity to move the market.

<img src="./assets/mmp/liquidity.png">

As we can see above in the image below the support levels `sell stops(Stoploss of long positions)` & `Buy Stops (Stoploss of short positions)` and thats we called as liquidity. Where insitutions can take out the retailers to take entry in the market with full potential & to move the market in its reverse direction to book their profits by exiting their quantities.

Liquidity can be the area below the support & above resistance levels by 20-30 pips of area.

**Strategy Using Liquidity :-**

We can use liquidity in our setups to identify where the price likely to move to grab the liquidity. We can `combine liquidity with orderblock + ICT OTE Entry + TP levels with fibs` for scalping on intraday 15m timeframe targetingn 20-25 pips.

<img src="./assets/mmp/liq-bearish-ob.png">
<img src="./assets/mmp/price-chasing.png">

The area we are able to see above in images is the zoomed area of retracement of price on support level from first image in this section.

As you can see bearish orderblock formed after before an down move is an bearish ordrblock which could be possibly entry of market makers. If the orderblock will be valid it will hold the price below of it until it reaches the liquidity pool below support levels.

<img src="./assets/mmp/liquidity-entry-levels.png">

When price retraces to that orderblock again we take entry setting take profits towars the liquidity below support levels by 20pips & by keeping the stoploss above the orderblock by 10-15 pips as mentioned in the image above.

**Results of above entry :-**

<img src="./assets/mmp/liquidity-trade-results.png">

As you can see above in the image price has breached our 20pip levels after our entry & hit our tp levels. We tookout profits partially for splitting our gains.

### Consideration in Risk Management

Trading is not about making profits, but its all about surviving in the market when you are not winning, and managing your capital accordinng to it. Those who survives leads to profitability.

Lets consider we have $10000 account in this section.

- **10% risk per trade :-**

<img src="./assets/mmp/rm-10.png">

Even if we loose 8 trades in row & if we are are risking `10%` per trade then it can lead us to `$5,217` in loss which is approx `52.17%` of our total capital. Its very usual to having loosing streak of 8 trades in row even we can loose 8 trades in single day.

It does not only affect our capital but it also affects our mental health as well.

Its very dangerous to keep 10% per trade.

- **5% risk per trade :-**

<img src="./assets/mmp/rm-5.png">

Even if you are a risk taker and if you keep 5% percent risk per trade you will be loosing `$3016.63` which is `30.17%` which can be easily happen if you have loosing trades in row. 

Its not advised to risk even 5% per trade.

- **2% risk per trade :-**

<img src="./assets/mmp/rm-2.png">

In the image above lets consider we have 2 traders keeping `2% risk per trade` but 2nd trader loose only `$538.14` which is `5.38%` of his equity & first trader lost `$1,318.74` which is `13.19%` of total equieity.

Let understand how second trader managed to loose only `5.38%` even after loosing 8 trades in row.

<img src="./assets/mmp/rm-2-second.png">

Let's consider second trader had even 16 more loosing trades stil he is only `12.67%` down which is `1,267.35` which is less than first trades 8 loosing streak loss.

How?????

First trader cut down his losses every time hee makes losses till he reaches `0.25% or 0.50%`.

Lets understand in more details, in first trade with the `2%` he lost `$200` then he cut down his risk to `1%` when he took second trade again he cut down risk to `0.5%` and he continued with `0.5%` risk per trade.


**How to ideally we should manage risk :-**

If we are new in the game we should keep `0.25 to 0.50%` risk per trade until you lead to your profitability of atleast start to see some profits.

Even if we start with 1% according to our experience & condfidence we should cut down our risk per trade when we get losses till we reach `0.25%` of your equity. 

When you gain or make profit till 50% of your loss amount which yout took with suppose `0.50%` risk then you should increase your risk by doubling it in reverse manner as we did when we lost the trades.

`Note :- Trading is all about shilding yourself from big institutions and profitable traders until you reach to the level of profitablity and to survive enough in the market till then. If you fail to follow risk management you will end up blowing more money than you can afford which will lead to mental drawdown due to which you will not be able to focus on trading anymore. So keep this in mind, game is all about survival not about getting rich in one night.`

### Essentials to Market Structure

<img src="./assets/mmp/multiple-timeframes.png">

<img src="./assets/mmp/keyto-multiple-timeframes.png">

Before entering into market structure you need to decide what type of trading personality you have which means either position trader, swing trader, short term trader & Day trades or scalping.

Because at least 3 timeframes should be used for analyzing the market structure according to higher timeframe directional premise.

In the above image according to your personality type you should choose your trading style & on the highest timeframe you should be analyzing where the market is heading, in the middle timeframe you are going to manage your trade & shortest timeframe should be used for your entry & exits.

**Types of market structure :-**

<img src="./assets/mmp/uptrend-ms.png">
<img src="./assets/mmp/downtrend-ms.png">

Price never moves in straight upwards or downwards. It moves up consolidates, moves up consolidates & when price moves at the key resistance levels it gives break of strucute against your previous swing lows on your `highest timeframe` which indicates the reversal in the market.

Price moves towards the key support on resistance levels because thats where the liquidy resides and price moves towards the liquidity, smart money moves the market towards the liquidity so that they can take out retailers & get maximum positions in the market before giving an move either towards upward or downward.

When the price gets to an important key support or resistance level we wait for the break of strucute & we zoom into that area by switching to smaller timeframe for looking out for entries with the help of ICT Optimal trade entry with fib retracement of `32%, 70.5% & 79%` retracement levels along with other confluences.

In the bullish market structure we look out for support is being respected & resistance is being broken & be comfortable if your supports taken out its grabbing liquidity to move even higher untill it reaches to important key support & resistance on your highest timeframe and in terms of bearish market structure resistance will be respected & support will be broken untill it reaches to important key support & resistance.

We mostly trade the setups in the consolidations happening before gaps with ote & with our other confluences & anticipate the move based on higher timeframe market structure.

**Long term & Intermediate Swing Points :-**

<img src="./assets/mmp/intermediate-swing-points.png">
<img src="./assets/mmp/intermediate-swingpoints2.png">

Long term & intermediate swing points are the points where there is high probability of big moves and that points gets respected by price most of the times.

Intermediate swing points can be identified by the point with `high's(at support level)` & `low's (at resistance)` on both side. And we try to catch the big move which is expected from that swing points.


**Time Price theory :-**

<img src="./assets/mmp/time-price-theory.png">

We need to start our analysis froim higher timeframe with key support & resistance levels, If your all timeframes confluences collapsing key support and resistance levels.

We look for the setup at specific time period of day on our smaller or medium timeframe according to their charecteristics. When price comes to your key support & resistance levels in the kill zones thats when you seek for entries.

We need to allign our higher timeframe market structure with key support & resistance levels & setups confirmation with multiple confluences is what the optimal trade entry is.


**Avoid Overcomplicating :-**

<img src="./assets/mmp/avoid-orvercomplicating.png">

Not always our directional bias bcomes correct, it does not guarantee direction or results of our trade.

In the bullish directional bias bearish trader can make money or even in bearish one buyer can make money its just probability of the movement not the direction, thats what called grey area whre you expect to things happen your analysis but there is no such guarantee about it.

### ICT KillZones

Killzones are the specific period of times in day at which its advised to look for opportunities and to trade with repetative patterns of their charecteristics.

- **Asian Kill Zone :-**

<img src="./assets/mmp/asian-killzone.png">

`EST - 8pm TO 12am` `IST - 6:30am - 10:30am` is the Asian kill zone is high volatility zone for AUD, NZD & JPY pairs are ideal to trade. According to volatility we can trade `AUD/JPY & NZD/JPY` in Asian kill zone.

Asian kill zone is 2hr pocket in which AUD, NZD & JPY pairs give some best setups according to their price actions.

Asian open can sometimes gives OTE scalp setups which offers 15-20 pipss & it can be drawn with higher timeframe of your setup, and fibs OTE retracement and other confirmation confluences.

  - **Charecteristics of asian session :-**

  <img src="./assets/mmp/asian-session.png">
  

  In this session market is not willing run mostly, it will be consolidation phase before the move of the day.

  But importantly asian session is important to find the probability of direction of the day & it extends to new york midnight times.

  In the asian session currency pairs including `USD` are not likely to moving, most probably those will be consolidating but the currencies are exotic currencies or including active pairs of the session such as `AUDJPY, NZDJPY, GBPAUD` etc.

  It provides much of OTE setups in the cross currencies & if you are some trader who does have time only in this session then you should take benifits of charecteristics in this session.

  In this timeperiod of day `USDX` USD Dollar Index is not active ther is no manipulation done in this session with USD but it will be done with other currencies and if we pair maojor currency pairs like `EUR` ,`GBP` with weaker currencies like `CHF`, `AUD, NZD`, `JPY` we can find OTE scalp setups for profitability.

- **London Open Kill Zone :-**  
  
  <img src="./assets/mmp/london-open.png">

  London Kill zone collides with the timing of the various news events, economics and all. London kill zone is `EST 2AM to 5AM ` which is `IST 12:30PM to 3:30PM`.

  The special charecteristics of london kill zone is it creates day high in downtrend & day low in uptrend. It helps us to determine the best entry point at low in uptrend & day high in downtrend direction.

  When it breaks up or breaks down `GMT 12AM` swing high or low which is `IST 5:30AM` it have great accuracy to form an OTE when it breaks out in downtrend & breaks down in uptrend direction.

  In this session  the forex pairs coupled with `EUR & GBP` are best pairs to trade.

  
  - **Charecteristics of London Session :-**
  
    <img src="./assets/mmp/london-session.png">
    <img src="./assets/mmp/london-chars.png">

    In the london session biggest move of the day is most likely to be formed in whole 24hours of the day, Most of the volumne & action does happen in london session.

    It has higher volume in terms of the order execution. If the biggest move of day doesnt happen in this session it continues & occurs in beginning of the new york session, If we had the trending move already in london session then we are likely to have less active new york session but if london doesnt gives any trending move then its more likely to happen in start of the new york session.


- **New York Kill Zone :-**

  <img src="./assets/mmp/newyork-killzone.png">

  New york kill zone opens at `EST 7:00AM TO 9:00AM` which is `IST 5:30PM  TO 7:30PM`
  In the New York Kill kill zone you get a setup daily in USD cross pairs for optimal entry.

  It offers scalp setup with minimum of 20-30 pips daily and new york session are the easiest session to trade & to find setups.

  - **New york session :-**

    <img src="./assets/mmp/newyork-session.png">

    Most of the economical news comes in the new york timings, & new york session can extends upto `EST 9:00PM TO 2:00PM` which is `IST 7:30PM TO 12:30PM`.

  - **Charecteristics of New York session -**
  
    New york session either continues the higher timeframe direction with an retracement or sometimes it can occur reversals in the market. 

    If the daily bias is bullish & in the london kill zone already formed day low then its most likely to have an small retracement in new york kill zone & trend continuation occurs. For the reversals it takes a lot of insights of the market which we will look further ahead.


- **London Close Kill Zone :-**

    <img src="./assets/mmp/london-close-killzone.png">
    <img src="./assets/mmp/london-close-setups.png">


    London close kill zone happens in `EST 10:00AM TO 12:00PM` which is `IST 8:30PM TO 10:30PM`. Major pairs such as `EURUSD, GBPUSD` or the other major pairs are ideal to trade in this kill zone.
    
    In the london close kill zone we get an optimal trade entry setups that can offer easily 10-20pips scalp.

    In the london close kill zone gives an retracement of the of day high on bullish days & retracement of day low on bearish days. It offers 5m OTE setups which is very shortterm move.

    We have to follow 5m timeframes in london close kill zone for finding OTE, anything higher than 5m timeframes will not provide you.


  - **Charecteristics Of London Close Kill Zone :-**
  
    <img src="./assets/mmp/london-close-chars.png">

    It creates continuation points for the trend of new york session swings. There is possibility of reversal of the daily & weekly trend as well in the london close for the direction of day or week.
    
    Highest point of the day is more likely to form in london close & Lowest point of the day is more likely to form in london close session but it can form in new york session as well.

### Weekly Bias for Short Term trading

<img src="./assets/mmp/weekly-bias-for-shorter-timeframe.png">

<img src="./assets/mmp/weekly-bias-shorter-timeframe2.png">

As we know the charecteristics of london open for forming daily low in bullish & daily high in bearish environments we can find the weekly low & weekly high as well so take short term weekly trades to grab the weekly trend.

In this module we would be focusing on finding the weekly low in bullsih enviornments & weekly high in bearish enviornments. We will be consuming weekly bias for specifying our entry point at low's & high to get maximum benifit out of weekly range.

`Weekly low(bullish Enviornments)` & `Weekly High(Bearish Enviornments)` forms most probably in between sunday open to wednsday new york open. The higher probability it will happen in between tuesdays london open to wendsday's new york open.

When week starts market markers moves the price in false direction for let people think is market is going lower and the people had bought on the opening price of the week will gets stopped out due to same.

When this false move engineered by the algorithm so the market makers & smart money can enter into the market on discounted price which is buying lower or selling higher than opening price & to drive that price in right direction whole week so they can book handsome amount of profits.

We can go in such as way that buy below `30pips` of opening price of week & keep the stop loss of `150pips` & target for `150-300` pips in it as an standard if you are not able to identify weekly low's or high's according to technical analysis.

`Note :- Price retraces on sunday opening on wednesday once & its expected but if price reaches again to sundays opening again we should better take exit of trade because its gonna be quiet or consolidating week.`

**How to know if low of the week formed on monday :-**

If the low of the week has been already formed on monday it will ride ahead of opening price. 

**Weekly bias bullish :-**

<img src="./assets/mmp/weekly-bias-bullish.png">

You can notice in the above image in the bullish week our weekly low has formed on tuesday london open & if we miss the london open low on tuesday it gives an retracement in wednsday' new york open for an second opportunity.

When we enter the position in either of the days we need to hold the trade until the end of the week or previous important level to reach on weekly or daily range to exit.

We can buy some quantity on monday's low, tuesday's low & wednsday's low and we can ride that trades till the end of week until we are able to figure out weekly high's & low's according to technical analysis.

**Weekly Bias Bearish :-**

<img src="./assets/mmp/weekly-bias-bearish.png">

You can notice in the above image in the bearish week our weekly low has formed on tuesday london open & if we miss the london open low on tuesday it gives an retracement in wednsday' new york open for an second opportunity.

When we enter the position in either of the days we need to hold the trade until the end of the week or previous important level to reach on weekly or daily range to exit.

We can sell some quantity on monday's low, tuesday's low & wednsday's low and we can ride that trades till the end of week until we are able to figure out weekly high's & low's according to technical analysis.

### ICT TIME & PRICE THEORY

<img src="./assets/mmp/monthly-open.png">

Monthly charts provides us the greater institutional bias, we will focusing on monthly opening price and our goal would be buying below monthly opening in bullsih scenario's & selling above monthly opening in bearish scenario's.

<img src="./assets/mmp/monthly-analysis.png">
<img src="./assets/mmp/monthly-analysis-daily.png">

Some people not able to do the intradat & short term trading due to their circumstances, business & etc so ict have analysis on monthly basis as well by which we can do long term trading. 

In the monthly analysis we are looking for price trading below the monthly opening price & give some sort of pattern or setup which we can figure out to plan the trades & when it comes to daily timeframe we are looking to buy at or below opening price in bullish env & selling above opening price in bearish enviornment.

Large institutions use the daily timeframe for their entries but we as intraday & scalpers look at the daily timeframe as higher timeframe.

This promotes the understanding of we should go from higher timeframe to lower timeframe & checking out if lower timeframes are also supporting the direction of higher timeframe bias & then to planning the trades in the according direction.

### Power of three (Accumulation, Manipulation & Distribution)

<img src="./assets/mmp/po3.png">
<img src="./assets/mmp/bullish-po3.png">
<img src="./assets/mmp/bearish-po3.png">

Power of three is cycle of daily range from opening to closing of that timeperiod. This concepts can be considered for any timeframe candles, we need to focus on open, high, low and close pricings.

- **Accumulation :-**
  
  <img src="./assets/mmp/bullish-accumulation.png">
  <img src="./assets/mmp/bearish-accumulation.png">

  Accumulation is the phase where order get collected below the opening price in bullish enviornment & above the opening price in bearish enviornment.

- **Manipulation :-**
  <img src="./assets/mmp/bullsish-manipulation.png">
  <img src="./assets/mmp/bearish-manipulation.png">

  One way and purpose of manipulation is the process of driving the market in the downside direction so smart money can buy at cheaper prices below than opening prices & in terms of bearish enviornments selling above the opening price they drive the market to the upside.

  Another way and purpose of manipulation is to knock out the retail traders who bought at the opening prices in bullish enviornments & who sold at the opening prices in bearish enviornments so smart money can have maximum position before the big move happes in day, month or according to your timeframes single candle.

- **Distribution :-**

  <img src="./assets/mmp/bullish-distribution.png">
  <img src="./assets/mmp/bearish-distribution.png">

  Distribution cycle where the smart money exists their orders by creating such a movement that retails traders will possibly willing to buy such as they will breakout the previous high in bullish environments or previous low in bearish environments so the retails traders will rush into buying because its an breakout of previous levels.

  Or the retail traders are planning to sell on those breakouts by taking out their stop losses which are buy stop orders smart money will exit from the market for their long positions.

### Importance of Asian Range

<img src="./assets/mmp/asian-range.png">

Asian range can possibly provide the direction in terms of intraday time period, When we can combine the directional bias with the asian range we can identify the direction of the day.

It is the consolidation period before impulse move starts for the day in london session.


**Implementing Asian range :-**

<img src="./assets/mmp/asian-range-implementation.png">
<img src="./assets/mmp/asian-range-implementation2.png">

Its begins at `EST 7:00PM to 12:00AM` which is `IST 4:30AM to 9:30AM` & in the asian range there is accumulation phase is going on.

If we draw the high or the asian range & low of the asian range there will be some buyers on the breakout of asian range & there will be some sellers on breakdown of the asian range so algorithm is designed in such a way that it will take the positions of buyers and sellers into wrong direction and continues its rally according to higher timeframe directional bias.

Price delivery algorithm of central banks get reset at the midnight, so after midnight price runs where the liquidity is. Its intensions are clearly to stop out the pending market orders above & below the asian ranges. 

**Utilization in bullish conditions :-**

<img src="./assets/mmp/ar-bullish-utilization.png">

We can extend the high & low of the asian range to future and there is very high probability when price will retraces in asian range high after breakdown thats where instutions gets involved in it.

In the bullish enviornment it will touch high of the asian range to trigger buy orders and then it runs towards their stoploss which are resting below the low of asian ranges. whne those stops are triggered and those retails traders got out of the market then it starts its bullish move to the upside.

  **Entries in bullish conditions :-**

  <img src="./assets/mmp/ar-bullish-entries.png">

  If price has already given the breakdown of asian range to the false directions below the `EST 12:00AM` midnight open price and if higher timeframe directional bias is also on bullish side then we can take entry at that fake out of the asian range to grab the low of the day in bullsih enviornments.

  If you have missed the opportunity by any chance on the false breakdown and then it went into bullish direction still if that price retraces on asian range high level you can take entry in same and to wait for let it run in its direction.


**Utilization in bearish conditions :-**

<img src="./assets/mmp/ar-bearish-utilization.png">

We can extend the high & low of the asian range to future and there is very high probability when price will retraces in asian range low after breakout thats where instutions get involved in it.

In the bearish enviornments it will touch the high of the asian range to trigger the buy orders and then it runs down to their stops and those who entered into sell positions at the touch of high of the asian range those will taken out by giving the huge breakout to asian range high and thats when it will start its real move to downside after taking out both direction traders.

  **Entries in bearish conditions :-**

  If the price has already taken out the retail traders by stopping them out by giving breakout to upside and also above the opening price of `EST 12:00AM` midnight open price and if higher timeframe directional bias is also bearish then we can take entry at the fakeout of high of the asian range to grab the high of the day in bearish enviornments.

  If you have missed the opportunity by any chance on the false breakout of asian range high and then went into bearish direction still if the price retraces to asian range low levle then we can take our entry in same to wait for let it run to its direction.

**Finding Till what level price can go for manipulation :-**

Mark the asian range and you can stack the the same area of asian range above in bearish enviornments & below in bullish environments and there is possiblity that price can go upto the double of asian range either or upside or downside.

**Finding till what level price can go for distribution :-**

Mark the range of judas swing and price goes 3 times of the judas swing upside in bullsih enviornments & downside in bearish enviornments.

### ICT JUDAS SWING

<img src="./assets/mmp/juda-swing.png">
<img src="./assets/mmp/bearish-judaswing.png">

Juda swing is the price swing happens in london session which sets the high & low of the london session. Run on stops means for stop loss hunting or retracing to key price level causes the juda swing in the london session.

It begins `EST 12:00AM TO 5:00AM` which is IST `9:30AM to 2:30PM` and its an false price direction swing to trick the traders for direction of the day which are lacking into higher timeframe directional bias.

**Charecteristics of judas swing :-**

<img src="./assets/mmp/juda-swing-chars.png">
<img src="./assets/mmp/bearish-judaswing-chars.png">

In bullish enviornments bearish false move after giving breakout to asian range high is bulliish juda swing.

In bearish enviornments bullish false move after breakdown to asian range low is bearish juda swing.

### Essentials to trading daily bias

<img src="./assets/mmp/daily-bias-essentials.png">

Most probably market be in 3 situations, uptrend, downtrend and range bound or consolidating in which market moves in between range.

Intermediate short term high's and lows are the levels where we plot the support and resistance and when the market is in the range bound phase or consolidation phase It possibility that when market given an breakout to any level by closing candles above it will possibly lead towards the next resistance level. And market fails to break some levels or not able to close daily the candle above or below it there is probability that there could be possibly reversal.

We should focus on previous day's high & low because in bullish enviornment market will keep piercing through & move towards previous day's high by respeting previous day's low until it reaches some intermediate level or swing point and in bearish enviornment market will keep piercing throgh & move towards previous day's low by respecting previous day's high until it reaches some intermediate level or swing point.

When market takes out previous day's high as well as low its possibly reversal because in the trending environments either it targets for previous day's high or previous day's low either.

### Engineering Daily Range (Trading key swing points)

**Asian Open :-**

  <img src="./assets/mmp/engineering-asian.png">

  As we have discussed earlier in power of three asian range gives us consolidation after london close of previous day and thats not the case always.

  Asia can create an low or high of the day as well, when there is impulsive or trending unidirectional move in asian range we can consider that asia might can create high in bearish enviornments & low of the day in bullish enviornments as mentioned above.

**London Open :-**

  <img src="./assets/mmp/engineering-london-open.png">

  As we have discussed earlier in power of three london open gives us the manipulation range in which it will gives us an false move with juda swing but its not the case always.

  When asian range had its trending move and already created the low in bullish enviornments & high in bearish enviornments then london open gives us and retracement to asian range after which the trend of the day continues ahead as mentioned above.

**New york Open :-**

  <img src="./assets/mmp/monthly-open.png">

  As we have discussed earlier in power of three new york open gives us an retracement to london range and then continues in directional rally but its not the case always.

  when the price is bit consolidating in throughout day even in asian & london session it can create high of the day in bearish environments & low of the day in bullish enviornements as mentioned above.

**London Close :-**

  <img src="./assets/mmp/engineering-londonclose.png">

  As we have discussed earlier in power of three london close either gives us the reversal of daily range or continuation of daily range but its not the case always.

  When the price is consolidating in huge range in the london close we can see an impulsive move which can create the high or low of the day.


When some important levles collapses with any kind kill zones along with their charecteristics such as for an example if you have bullish day & price have reached at important key swing point from the higher timeframe in the london close kill zone which is having high probability of reversal then we can have the sell trade over there which would be high probability trade.

When we combine the higher timeframe levels with other conflences along with sessions or morever with timings thats where high probability trading setups forms.


### Money Management

<img src="./assets/mmp/money-management.png">

Every trader faces the lineup of loosing trades but that every traders make the mistake to recover those losses, increases their lot size, overleaverages and they make the situation even worse that thy blow their account.

Very first step of money management is to stop the bleeding, we need to identify the wrong trades before placing the next trades and we need to resolve the mistake before placing the next trades.

To stop the bleeding we can reduce the lot size to half whatever it was perviously and we can increase the lot size whne you have high probability setups thats how we are going to reduce the amount of lossing trades & increase the amount of profitable trades.

**Reducing Losses & Increasing profits :-**

**Model 1 :-**

  <img src="./assets/mmp/managing-money.png">

  In the Model 1 we do small start such as with minimum leaverage or lot size according your trading plan and whenever we are winning we are adding 2% more risk or leaverage & when we win 5 consecutive trade in row we reduce our lotsize & leaverage to the minimum for preparing the next upcoming drawdown.

**Model 2 :-**

  <img src="./assets/mmp/managing-money2.png">

  In the Model 2 we do modest or medium start with medium leaverage and lot size according your trading plan and whenever we are winning we are adding 2% more risk or leaverage & when we win 5 consecutive trade in row or if we have loosing trade we reduce lotsize & leaverage to the minimum for preparing the next upcoming drawdown.

`Note :- This is the best money management model which we can use to cut down leaverage and lot size after loosing trade & increasing it when winning.`

**Comparision money management & without money management :-**

<img src="./assets/mmp/money-management-curve.png">

Both of the traders on left as well as on the right side have same risk to reward ratio but the equity curve of trader on right side only having difference is he is reducing the risk when he gets an loosing trade.

When we reduce our risk after loosing trades we are preventing our profits until our next win rally starts to kick in. as soon as we get an loss we are preparing for lossing streak with the help of which money is growing drastically but reducing very slowly.

When money grows drastically and reducing slowly thats when we turn into profitable trader. In this trading journey we might face more losses than winnings so we should be prepared for taking loosing streaks by cutting down losses.

### Smart Money Technique (SMT)

There are co-relation in betwee forex pairs & USD index which is USDX and forex pairs such as `AUDUSD, GBPUSD, EURUSD, USDCHF` etc.

<img src="./assets/mmp/smt.png">

Now if you can notice in the above image lets consider crud price action in red color is usdx & blue is AUDUSD, as they are opposing pairs their natural behaviour should be when usdx is making higher high's audusd should be making lower low's and vice versa when usdx is making lower low's audusd supposed to make higher high's.


**SMT Divergence in bullish enviornment :-**

<img src="./assets/mmp/bullish-smt.png">

If audusd is making lower low's and usdx is making higher high's but suddenly audusd failes to make lower low's which means there is accumulation going in audusd & usdx failes to make higher high which means huge distribution going in the usdx due to which usdx is not able to make higher high.

If usdx failing to make higer high or audusd is failing to making lower low's both indicates to bullish possibility in audusd.

**SMT Divergence in bearish enviornment :-**

<img src="./assets/mmp/bearish-smt.png">

If audusd is making higher high & usdx is making lower lows and if audusdx failes to make higher high's or usdx fails to make lower low's then which means there is huge possibility that bearish trend can occur in audusd due to ongoing bearish accumulatoin in audusd & distribution in usdx due to which it failed to make higher high.

`NOTE :- SMT divergence can be very useful to identify the reversal in the markets where price action is also showing weakness in current trend and also there is confluence of divergence in usdx which could lead to possible reversals.`

When there is weakness is going on either in uptrend or downtrend in usdx then we searcch for the major currencies shows the divergence & weakness according to usdx divergence and we look for entry in that pairs.


### ATM Method 

<img src="./assets/mmp/atm-method.png">

This is an standalone price action pattern occurs on stop runs which forms on 1h timeframe.

**Bearish Enviornment :-**

<img src="./assets/mmp/bearish-atm.png">

<img src="./assets/mmp/bearish-atm-chart.png">

<img src="./assets/mmp/bearish-atm-chart2.png">

When price breaks out previous high in uptrend as mentioned by star in the above image and take reversal and breaks down previous low and retraces it thats when we can plan for entry.

Majorly when short term low is broken down & retraced to that level after bullish enviornment then we can plan the trade by targetting previous swing low and by keeping SL above 5-10 pips of swing high.

We can zero down our stop loss on 15m timeframe by analyzing the chart.

**Bullish Enviornment** 

<img src="./assets/mmp/bullsih-atm.png">

When price breaks down previous swing low in downtrend & as mentioned by star in the above image and take reversal and breaks out previous low and retraces it thats when we can plan for entry.

Majorly when short term high is broken out and retraced to that level in after bearish enviornment then we can can plan the trade by targetting previous swing high and by keeping SL above 5-10 pips of swing low.

We can zero down our stop loss on 15m timeframe by analyzing the chart.


### Optimal Trade Entry (OTE)

<img src="./assets/mmp/ote-bullish.png">
<img src="./assets/mmp/ote-bearish.png">

Optimal trade entry is the way to get entry into trending market when it retraces.

There are some important factors to consider while practicing optimal trade entry is the direction of your trade should be with higher timeframe direction, the price you are drawing fibs should given an break of structure and we should consider OTE's on higher timeframes as it gives us clear idea about the direction of the market.

We have specific retracement levels along with take profits levels as well for our OTE models as mentioned below.

**Fibonacci retracement levels :-**
- **62% -** 0.618
- **70.5% -** 0.705
- **0.79% -** 0.79

**Take Profits Levels :-**
- **1.27 (TP 1) -** -0.27
- **1.62 (TP 2) -** -0.62
- **2 (TP 3) -** -1

<img src="./assets/mmp/OTE-EX.png">

Every broker can manipulate the price by little up or down move so its better to mark the fib from body to body levels due to which you will be able to cop up with their sweep movements based on brokers.

### Target Selection & Profit Objectives

We can find the profit objective levels for weekly by checking out the multiple confluence to one of the important levels with multiple price swings overlapping its important price levels.

<img src="./assets/mmp/wp-objective.png">


You can checkout in the above image for bullish enviornment `1.1924 to 1.1935` we are having multiple fibonacci expansion levels overlapping which makes it high probability area for getting out of the trade and book the profits for the weekly trades. 

<img src="./assets/mmp/wp-objective2.png">

You can checkout in the above image for bearish enviornment `1.2689 to 1.2682` we are having multiple fibonacci expansion levels overlapping which makes it high probability area for getting out of the trade and book the profits for the weekly range or trades.

We can get exit on any instituional level in that range but its better to get out of the trade from the bottom till middle level so we are not trying to catch the top of the market & we will be exit of the trade even if we will be having higher spreads.

### Trade Psychology

**Major Psychological Barriers :-**

- **Fear of missing moves :-** 
  
    We should not fear of missing moves because in the market there are 100's of opportunities which are tradeable, so we should not fear if we have missed the moves either we should focuing on trading quality setups.

- **Fear of loosing :-**

    You need to reduce your risk because even if you loose with low risk it wont impact you much but even after reducing your risk to minimum and still you are afraid then trading is not for you.

- **Impatience between setups :-**

    when you are waiting for some level but you are entering into trade before it reaches to your level, but it can be dealt with by the experience.

    Whenever we win the trade we are impatient to enter into next setups most specially when you win the trade we trade those setups which aren't your setups its not advised to trade until and unless your setups is into the picture.

- **Fear of not being good enough :-** 

    This factors comes from social media by comparing us to others because there must be possibility you must be comparing yourself with more experienced trader or the one who already spent more time than yours.

    You should only care about your trade journal in terms of are you seeing the improvements and work for reducing your mistakes and refining your setups.

- **Fear of loosing streaks & Draw down :-**

    Fear of loosing streaks & draw down is all about the money management as we have discussed in above models, if you are afraid of loosing streak reduce the amount of your risk 

- **Lack of discipline & follwing rules :-**

    By human nature we are habitual to do the things which we are not suppopsed to do, but we can overcome this things by just follwing the rules.

- **Searching for next best thing :-**

    People follows the crowd, some fancy guru's comes with new things up and then but we need to follow our setup for long enough to see the results by refining it over the period.

    When we know the timings of happening our setups then we are not searching for next better things of afraid of loosing opportunities because we know very well at what timings our setups can form and we dont need to keep looking at charts.

**Effective Journaling :-**

  - **Daily Entry Logs & Weekly Log Reviews :-**
  
    We need to enter our trades daily into your trade journals and we need to review it weekly and need to check out the mistakes we have made and what was the best things we have followed.

  - **How you felt going into the trading day :-**
  
    Whatever we brings to the market in terms of emotions such as if you are already depressed, anxiety or emotioal damage our psyhology we are going to make mistakes due to that emotional stage of ours so its better to be away from the market when you are in such scenarios for protecting yourself to getting involved into more emotions due to your trades.


  - **Record any concerns or fears you had in price action :-**

    Whatever we feel before entering or after entering trade by seeing charts and all we need to record those emotions and need to record how much times it hit your stoploss, how you handelled it and what was the resultant of it.

    When in future where you are going to have same feeling you would be knowing already how you handelled that and what are its impacts etc.

  - **Contrast your personal expectations vs actual result :-**
  
    Write your expectations vs what was the actual results of your expectations after the trades which gives you an idea of what you did right whenever you were winning and what wrong things you been doing when you were loosing and how you tackled it.

  - **Detail where you felt uncertanity & how you coped :-**
  
    How many times price altered with your limit order levels, how many times your stoploss is about to hit or how many times how early you trailed your stoploss when its going into your way you need to record this uncertainities and how you coped with it such as you went for walk when you were having anxiety, you followed your trading plan by avoiding uncertainities and how you distracted yourself for letting it execute how its supposed to be.

  - **Use positive words for those things you did well on :-**
  
    We need to record how we followed our plan, how we followed our plan, how we followed our trading rules and money management you need to record those in good words so we should feel prod about ourselves.

    We need to appriciate ourselves when we are doing things how we supposed to do no matter if the trade is loosing & winning you need to follow through your trading plan, trading rules &  money management.

  - **Avoid negatively charged words where you strugggled :-**
  
    Do not use negative words when you made mistakes or not followed your trading plan and system, write it down in such way that when ever you are reading through journal you should be feel to resolve those mistakes. It should not be stressfull where you will not able to focus on problem rahter than your negative sentences which will bring you down in your mind.

### COT (Commitment of traders) Insights for effective price action

COT(Commitment of traders) data is the data of `Commertical traders (Banks, Headge funds, Fund managers)`, `Small Speculators (Retail Traders like small traders like us)` & `Large Speculators (Pvt Tradres, Big traders with funds)`.


Normally this Commercial traders have idea about where market navigates to upside or downside according to the actions of commercial traders.

**How to Navigate to COT data :-**

- Go to barcharts.com
- Select our currency in dropdown named as `select commodity` aside of searchbar.

  <img src="./assets/mmp/cot-navigation.png">

- Select the chart with most open intrest as like mentioned below.

  <img src="./assets/mmp/cot-navigation-oi.png">

- Click on technical Chart

- Scroll down to bottom of the page & do the follwing settings.

  - Change OHLC to Candlesticks.
  - Turn Contract volume off.
  - Uncheck the price box.
  - Select period as Weekly contract.
  - select period of 3 years or maximum period.
  - add technical study for Commitment of traders.
  - select study size & chart size large
  - Finally click on draw chart.

**COT Analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/mmp/cot-analysis.png">

We need to focus on `Commercial traders & Large Speculators` the `0 line which indicates neutral`, `commercial traders move above 0 line is bullish` and `commercial traders move below 0 line is bearish`.

Whenever commercial traders are long market moves upwards & when they are short market moves downwards.

For the currency we are analysing the cot chart if its base currency in currency pair then its will be moving in the same direction and when the currency we analysing is quote currency then currency price will be moving in inverse direction.

We need to get into the same direction of commercial traders because we will be in the sync of smart money move then.

Whenever equal got lows taken out we can see an big move towards the upside & when equal high's get taken out then we can expect big move towards downside.

### How to find explosive move before they happen

We are going to focus on cot report and weekly range contractions & daily range contractions.

<img src="./assets/mmp/cot-extremes.png">

<img src="./assets/mmp/cot-extremes2.png">

We are observing cot data for euro on weekly timeframe on which we will be going to focus on the moves of the commercial traders.

Checkout when the price was falling commercials was buying means they were accumulating the orders & in the second image you can see near `1.04000` there are equal lows means potential support zone is getting created and formed with respect to commercial traders intrest.

Now you can notice after 3rd touch on the support line commercials went into selling which means there is possiblity that uptrend move is having high probability because commercials already started selling as we know they buy when market is falling & they sell when market is raising.

**Weekly Range Contractions :-**

<img src="./assets/mmp/weekly-range-contraction.png">
<img src="./assets/mmp/weekly-range-contraction2.png">
<img src="./assets/mmp/weekly-range-contraction3.png">

In weekly range contractions we will be focusing on power of 3 of weekly range and we will be looking for contractions in weekly range such as bodies or candles getting small which indicates prior candle to big move.

Lets consider if Monday was accumulation, tuesday was manipulation & we are able to see small body candle on wednesday which means there is high probability that thursday can be having large candle or bigger move.


**Daily Range Contraction :-**

<img src="./assets/mmp/daily-range-contraction.png">
<img src="./assets/mmp/daily-range-contraction2.png">

In the daily range as well will be focusing on power of theree in which we will be focusing on contractions such as small body candles in the daily chart wihch indicates prior candle to big move or big day next.

Retail traders get boring and no one notices the small moves or it seems boring to them but we as ict traders wants to get into the market before the big moves happens rather than chasing when big move is happening like retailers. And with the help of daily & weekly range contraction we can find opprotunities with other confluences.

### Higher timeframe concepts

<img src="./assets/mmp/key-levels.png">
<img src="./assets/mmp/price-rejections.png">

In this section we will be focusing on higher timeframe price action such as key levels on higher timeframe as mentioned in the image above & Price rejections on those important levels.

What we are going to do is we analyze `USDX` very first in wich we try to get the direction of usdx according to its price action & market structure and then we checkout the major pairs one by one which are complementing the direction of `USDX` acording the place of USD as base or quote.

We can mark these important levels on our charts for the currency pair we are having clarity of direction according to its key levels, and we patiently wait for the setups to form on those key levels with taking out liquidity above and below these levles and we enter into position for targetting next key level as like mentioned below.

<img src="./assets/mmp/keylevels-trading.png">

As you can see above we have marked yearly range into our frame & we have divided quaters into 4 different parts in which we have marked the key levels for yearly, quaterly, monthly and when price gets to key resistance zone we will be taking entry for sell & buy for vice versa.

Because market reaches for large and institutional liquidity pools thats why price trade towards this key levels.


### Secrets to forex trading

We will be focusing on buy & sell conditions mapping and implementing the OTE setups.

<img src="./assets/mmp/sft-fib-entry.png">
<img src="./assets/mmp/sst-fib-entry.png">

When we are hunting for setups first condition is `9 & 18` or `10 & 20` moving averages should be in bullish on daily, 4h and also on 1h timeframe. there is possiblity that on 1h timeframe price can pierce through moving averages but the averages should not cross over to each other of any of the timeframe.

The reason we use & consider moving averages in institional trading moving averages are used by large funds and they are trend following in nature which even instituional traders use for their entries.

When we are marking the fibs in ote setup remember that we should mark the fibs from the lowest body to the highest body. not from the recent swing low means lowest wick to highest wick.

We need to filter out our setups to the best ones, and we should not rush for finding the setups.

`Note :- If the ideal scneario on higher timeframe bearish but if we are having bullish moving averages on 1h timeframe and we are able to find the bullish setup we can trade that setup but in the intraday point of view which we need to keep in mind. If our objective is swing trade then we need to wait for setups in the direction of higher timeframe moving averages direction and till all moving averages get lined up in same direction.`

# Market Marker Series

### Macros of market maker

<img src="./assets/mmm/who-market-maker.png">

Who is market maker?

Market makers are the central banks and those are producers of currency prices thats why they are the market makers and curreny prices are whole and solly managed by central banks.

Investment funds, Investment banks, dealers are not the market makers, they acts as an broker who consumes the price produced by market makers and they do business with central banks.

Central banks are not follwing any indicators such as Support & Demand Zone, Stocastic etc, they work with high tech algorithms to deliver the currency prices relatime which cause the movement in price realtime.


**Quantitative Analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/mmm/quantitive-analysis.png">

Quantitative analysis is stastical & data based analysis which means indirectly the fundamental analysis.

What drives the forex market, we can refer to 2 importnat things which are as mentioned below along with their resources.

**Global Intrest Rates :-** 

  `https://www.global-rates.com/en/interest-rates/central-banks/`

  In the global intrest rate we look for differential, which means difference between one countries intrest rate between another.

  On the central banks level they are always seeking for yeild which means returns, lets take an example would we be in country which have intrest rate of 5% or would we choose country which have 2%, obviously 5% because you will get higher retruns in the same way central banks thinks.

  Central banks get to know about the intrest rates or highest yield from global rates itself, they look for highest intrest rate currency & lowest intrest rate pair coupled together they trade.

  Higher intrest rate currency have positive differential & lower intrest rate currency pair have negative differential.


**Commitment of Trades :-** 

  `www.barchart.com > select commodity > select highest open intrest > open interactive chart > +study > cot > add`

With the help of this 2 parameters we can perform fundamental analysis on forex market & we can plan for buy or sell programme.


**Analysis based on this both factors :-**

<img src="./assets/mmm/intrest-rates-ex.png">

Lets consider the JPY & USD intrest rates from the above pictures from which we are able to know that JPY having negative differential & USD is having higher differential by keeping this in mind lets switch to COT data for this currencies.

<img src="./assets/mmm/usdx-cot.png">

Now when we have jumped to COT data we are looking for most highest point where commercials went long & most lowest point where commercials went short, as you can see in picture in between dec & feb commercials went long with highest cot representation which itself gives an bullish signal

BUT

<img src="./assets/mmm/jpy-cot.png">
<img src="./assets/mmm/jpy-bms.png">

You can notice in between nov & feb or in january commercials went to net short position with extreme down of cot data and they never been bearish that much below 0 line till yet by itself doesn't mean to anything, But you need to see an break in market structure which means price breaks the market structure by breaking its recent swing low or high which we can see above in the above in second picture.

Now everything comes into line up such as commercails are bearish on yen, bullish on dollar & intrest rates are also higher on dollar & bearish on yen and thats when algorithm reprices as we can see above aftre breaking market strcuture jpy moved sharply to downside.

**Conclusion on forex pair :-**

<img src="./assets/mmm/usdjpy-conclusion.png">

We have saw that commercials went long in usdx & net short in usdjpy, jpy also given break in market structure and also our intrest rates are directing us in the same way.

Now in USDJPY USD is base currency and in dollar commercials went net long so you can expect bullish rally in USDJPY.

As you can see in the chart for usdjpy above near around january it given brake of structure after which it rallyed up according to our analysis derived based on intrest rates & cot data.

`Note :- We dont decide our bias based on only intrest rates but we wait for central banks movement to get aligned into the direction of intrest rates and thats when we also plan for entries.`

### Institutional order flow & understanding liquidity

We start our analysis with weekly timeframe by trying to understand what price action is goingon weekly timeframe and we try to understnad our weekly direction.

We look for clear and obviously levels market can go for grabbing the liquidity which means the stoplosses of the retail traders, to find consistant profitability and consistant setups we look for run/draw on liquidity.

<img src="./assets/mmm/weeky-liquidity.png">

So if we are looking at the last candle in the above chart we can see there is clean and obvious price level where stoploss would be resting of the people whoe took short on that retracement, so according to that we can understand that price will be bullish atleast till drawing through that nearest liquidity pool.

In such scenarios we will look for buying on or below the opening price so we can take benifit out of our bullish weekly range.

<img src="./assets/mmm/daily-ob.png">
<img src="./assets/mmm/ob-hourly-levels.png">

Until now we have bias that our weekly range will be bullish according and now we have switched to daily timeframe in monday's candle been bullish & tuesday's candle returned back to order block candle on daily timeframe.

The second image mentioned above in which we have shifted to hourly timeframe & blue line is orderblock level to which price took out preivous low's having trailed stoploss orders of previously long positioned traders and entered into orderblock and rallyed up.

<img src="./assets/mmm/ob-kllzone-entry.png">

You can notice in the above image that price has retraced into daily level order block in tuesday's london open kill zone where all analysis points are getting lined up such as weekly bias going bullish to takeout short term high's liquidity, on the daily level it started move and orderblock formed on daily level and on the higher timeframe it tooks out previous swing lows for liquidity and enter into orderblock in tuesday's london open so all the things are getting lined up into the single direction which makes it high probability trade.

As a trader we need to find out multiple confluences indicating in same direction of your analysis thats where high probability setups forms.


**Note :- If price takes out swing high or low and then enters into orderblock according to daily or weekly direction then its an high probability orderblock, not every candle prior to move is an order block & gives us right results.**



### Market Structure, Key Level & SMT

- **Market Maker Buy Model :-**

  As we know that key levels are the swing high's & low's on higher timeframe such as monthly, weekly and daily but we can consider 4h key levels as well on less priority.

  <img src="./assets/mmm/breaker-model.png">

  We wait untill price comes near to key level and it creates market maker bullish breaker model as we have seen in `previous market maker primer series` in which we wait for brakedown of importnat level & when price reversed in bullish direction and given breakout to its previous swing and when it retraces we take entry into trade as shown in first image.

  <img src="./assets/mmm/smt-divergence.png">

  Another model is when price comes near to key level and it creates divergence as shown in second picture it fails to create more lower low and when its co-related currency made its higher high such as `eurusd failed to make lower low on important level and usd is continuing its higher high's` then its an high probability buy model and we can take entry into those trades.


  <img src="./assets/mmm/mm-buy-model.png">

  In the consolidation in green area smart money will take huge sell positions to push the price lower & lower till the key level with bearish market structure and consolidations and when they enter into smart money reversal zone they take out imporant levels liquidity and grab huge quantities take the price higher till or the previous consolidations high.

  We as conservative trader we dont enter into grey area which is smart money reversal area, we wait for some sort of confirmation such as breaker moedel or SMT divergence and when it gives its next retracement thats where we take entry to be along with commercial traders.

  <img src="./assets/mmm/mmbm-ex.png">
  <img src="./assets/mmm/mmbm-smt-ex.png">
  <img src="./assets/mmm/mmbm-smt-ex2.png">

  Here is the example of our above analysis.

- **Market Maker Sell Model :-**

    As we know that key levels are the swing high's & low's on higher timeframe such as monthly, weekly and daily but we can consider 4h key levels as well on less priority.

  <img src="./assets/mmm/braker-sell-model.png">
    
    We wait untill price comes near to key level and it creates market maker bearish breaker model as we have seen in `previous market maker primer series` in which we wait for breakout of importnat level & when price reversed in bearish direction and given brakedown to its previous swing high then it retraces that's when we take entry into trade as shown in first image.

  <img src="./assets/mmm/smt-divergence-bearish.png">

    Another model is when price comes near to key level and it creates divergence as shown in above image it fails to create more lower low and when its co-related currency made its higher high such as `eurusd failed to make lower low on important level and usd is continuing its higher high's` then its an high probability buy model and we can take entry into those trades.

  <img src="./assets/mmm/mm-sell-model.png">

   In the consolidation in green area smart money will take huge buy positions to push the price higher & higher till the key level with bullish market structure and consolidations and when they enter into smart money reversal zone they take out imporant levels liquidity and grab huge quantities take the price lower till or the previous consolidations low.

  We as conservative trader we dont enter into grey area which is smart money reversal area, we wait for some sort of confirmation such as breaker model or SMT divergence and when it gives its next retracement thats where we take entry to be along with commercial traders.

### Time & Price Theory

<img src="./assets/mmm/time-price-weekly.png">

According to price time theory we look for weeky lows in bullish week likely to form on mondays, tuesday's and wednesday's new york open, and in bearish enviornments the weekly high likely to form on mondays, tuesday's and wednesday's new york open.

We should look for the entries only on monday, tuesday's and wednesday for weekly range and we should take entry either at the opening price or when price is trading below opening price for bullish week and vice versa for bearish week.

`Note :- Don't take any entries on thursday and friday in terms of weekly range because on those days it would have already expanded.`

<img src="./assets/mmm/time-price-weekly2.png">
<img src="./assets/mmm/time-price-weekly3.png">

Lets brakedown our entry and checkout the price action on 15m timeframe, as we have discussed above we will be seeking entries on monday's, tuesday's and wednesday's.

As we can noitice in the above image we have kill zones marked with orange lines, and we dont look for entry anywhere in those 3 days but we look for entries in either london or new york kill zones.

As you can see on the mondays in the london we have optimal trade entry and in new york kill zone how price rallyed after braking the previous low's but ICT dont recommends to trade on mondays because in the tuesday's trading range there is possibliy it can take out mondays entries for liquidity.

On the tuesday as you can see price had ran towards mondays new york low of monday and took out the trades and if we consider mondays low & tuesday's run on liquidy we are having an optimal trade entry and at those levels with the confirmation of previous swing low liquidity run so we can take for entry in tuesday's london open most of the time.

We need to combine the setup with time such as kill zones at the first place and its an crucial factor for reading price, in those timeframes we need to buy below opening price in bullish enviornments & sell above opening price in bearish enviornments with entry pattern can be anythig such as run on `previous swing levels, orderblock entry or optimal trade entry`. 

The reason this things work at certain timings of day is central banks price delivery algorims works timebased but not on the based on what the majority of people doing

### Daily Bias & Generic Market Macros

<img src="./assets/mmm/mon-daily-range.png">
<img src="./assets/mmm/tue-daily-range.png">


Priorly as we have analyzed our weekly prespective is bullsish for taking our the Sell Side liquidity, on that same basis we are diving into the daily range.

We are having look into the daily range on `5m timeframe` on which we are looking for daily macro's.

We need to buy below the opening price which is `12:00AM EST` & `9:30AM IST` which ususally happens in london open kill zone, and we wait till london close for the day high to form and we need to exit our trade.

<img src="./assets/mmm/wed-daily-range.png">

Above image is wednsday daily range on fomc day where every swing high and low is getting taken out and not letting any position be safe in the market.

`Note :- We will not refer opening price on thursday's and friday's because we are already late in the week and we would be looking for other setups such as OTE, OB or run on swing levels.`

<img src="./assets/mmm/thurs-daily-range.png">

As you can see in the image above we will be not referring for opening price and we in the london open you can see we got optimal trade entry and other setups such as orderblock or run on swing levels will work.

<img src="./assets/mmm/fri-daily-range.png">

In the above image its the daily range for friday in which we broke thursday's high and also we have reached to wekely timeframe liquidity area.

In the very next swing of it you can we shift in market structure where previous swing low has been taken out and we will be expecting downside because algorithm will likely to trade back into weekly range it mets its weekly objective.

# ICT OTE Series

### OTE FIBS CONFIG
<img src="./assets/ote/ote-fib-settings.png">

### Optimal Trade Entry (No Daily Bias & Time based)

We need to focus on previous day's high & low on intraday timeframe such as `5m` timeframe or `15m` timeframe.

If we are in bullish enviornment and if price is reaching towards previous day's high and it brakeouts it very badly with great move & in terms of bearish envonment and if price is reaching towards previous day's low it can brakedown very badly with great move.

Optimal trading is not about checking out the retracements & rushing for trade, its not an optimal trade entry but an fibonacci trading.

<img src="./assets/ote/ote-ny.png">

What makes trade entry optimal is if thats occuring at specific times of the day, And that time is `EST 8:30AM TO 11:00AM` which is `IST 6:00 TO 8:30PM` and if price is retracing in between `62% to 79%` retracement level marked the fibs on previous day's high (in terms of bullish bias) or previous day's low (in terms of bearish bias) brakeout swing or short term high & short term low around it.

`Note - In terms of OTE setup even if we dont have daily bias we need to checkout in EST 8:30AM TO 11:00AM which is IST 6:00 TO 8:30PM previous day high or previous day's low is been taking out and we need to checkout if its creating and optimal trade entry.`

We can target for `1.5 & 2` as Take profit levels and we need to round that price level with nearest round number of instituaional level & We can keep the stoploss `below the swing low` on which we are targetting fibs below some pips which would fit your risk to reward ratio and it should have breathing space for it.

When price moved towards your trade direction move your stoploss to above our entry point by 2-3 pips, in such ways we are having 2 pieces of profits rather than loss and if price already moved towards your 2 targets then move your stoploss to level which is not equal `high's or low's` but to the swing `low or high` which took out equal levels.

Always keep your some part of your trade without booking profit & look for `3` level which would be double of your swing on which you have marked fibs for OTE & no matter price skyrocket after that but just get out of the trade at maximum of `3` level, If your `3 level more than 100 pips` then take partial on `100 pips`

### Day 2 of OTE Setup

We would be looking for OTE setup on USDJPY setup in this section by following all the rules as we have studied above.

**Daily Timeframe Analysis & View :-**

<img src ="./assets/ote/day2-ote-daily.png">

As you can see in the previous swing we have drawn the fibs on which it retraced in OTE levels which are `62% to 79% retracement levels` and on the 6th of may price has retraced into OTE.

on the day of 7th of may we have broke the previous day high in which means we can expect price is reversing to upside and we can expect taking out previous day high to be taken.

**5m Timeframe Analysis & View :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day2-ote-5m.png">

According to our daily bias we are looking for taking out previous day high so we have found the opportunity for OTE entry by considerting previous day low to recent high swing.

On that swing in the timeframe of `EST 8:00AM TO 11:00AM` which is `IST 6:00PM TO 8:30PM` and price retraced into our OTE range which is `62% TO 79% retracement levels`.

We have planned the entry on price above retracement by keeping stoploss below fib swing low & targetting `1,1.5 & 2` fib extension levels and price has delivered results as expected exactly.

### Day 3 of OTE Setup

In this section we will be going to find the ote pattern & setup on futures contract rather than forex as we have discussed setup is not limited to forex only.

**Daily timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day3-ote-daily.png">

As we can see on the daily timeframe price is retraced in OTE and continuing its bullish rally but we are concerned about our daily timeframe direction which seems to be bullish with the help of this analysis.

**5m timeframe Analysis & View :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day3-ote-15m.png">

As we can see we have drawn previous day high & fridays high on our 5m timeframe & we have marked our OTE timezone which is `EST 8:30 TO 11:00` which is `IST 6:00 to 8:30` we got an retracement on recent swing when price swept `2900.00` big figure.

We took entry on `70.5` retracement level & targeted `0.5, 1 & 2` levels of fibonacci extension for profit booking which is targetting previous day high.

### Day 4 OTE setup

In this section we will be looking for ote setup on `GBPUSD` as mentioned below.

**1h analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day4-ote-1h.png">

As we can see price has took buyside liquidity and given brakedown to its swing low where market has shifted its structure which we call market structure shift.

After market structure shift it has retraced to its swing low and brakedown level according to braker model so we will be looking for bearish profile.

**5m timeframe Analysis & View :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day4-ote-5m.png">

As you can see we have marked our previous day low ON 5m chart as we are expecting bearish profile according to 1h chart analysis, In our OTE timezone which is `EST 8:30 TO 11:00` which is `IST 6:00 TO 8:30` we are able to see price given a optimal trade entry near the braker and retraced in OTE retracement levels which are `62% to 79% retracement level`.

We will be taking entry on the retracement by keeping stoploss above the swing high on which we have marked the fib & we will be targeting  `0,0.5, 1 & 2` levels.

<img src="./assets/ote/day4-ote-5m-2.png">

We got one more entry in our ote timeframe as mentioned above we took entry on our OTE retracement levels which are `62% to 79% retracement level` by keeping stop loss above swing low & we will be targetting only `0,0.5 & 1` level because its the below levle of previous day low for which price is targetting.

We cannot expect price to pierce previous day levels so much so we rounded up our profit levle with `1.267000` and we need to get out of the trade without expecting to catch top & bottom of the markets.

### Day 5 OTE setup

In this section we will be looking for our setup on `S & P 500 EMINI futures` contract as our setup is not forex dependant only.

**1h timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day5-ote-1h.png">

Our higher timeframe bias is our price was revolving around previous fridays high but shifted its market structure to bearish by breaking its previous swing low & retraced around the braker which itself bearish indication.

We have marked previous day low which will be targetting according to our bearish prespective on hourly direction.

**5m timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day5-ote-5m.png">

As we have marked preivous day low earlier for targetting accoring to our higher timeframe basis, we will be looking for our ote setup inside `EST 8:30 TO 11:00`  which is `IST 6:00 TO 8:30`.

we found a setup where price retraced into ote retracement range which is `62% to 79% retracement levels` keeping stoploss above the swing high & we will be targetting only `0,0.5 & 1` level as we are looking for price movement below previous day low for seeking liquidity.

### Day 6 OTE setup

In this section we will be looking for ote setup on CRUDEOIL as we know that OTE is not limited to only forex market.

**Daily timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day6-ote-1d.png">

As you can see above price made equal highs in past some days and also an inverted shooting start candle which is retailers favioraite for short selling.

But according to our ICT trader pov we as there are equal highs in the range price will be going to grab that liquidity and on the current day price will move upside to takeout preivous day's high according to our bullish bias.

**15m timeframe :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day6-ote-5m.png">

As we have bullish bias according to daily timeframe levle we will be looking for ote setup inside ote timeblock which is `EST 8:30AM TO 11:00AM` which is `IST 6:00 : 8:30AM`.

We found ote setup inside our time block & we will be takingentry on ote retracement `62% to 79%` by keeping stoploss below swing low & targetting `0,0.5,1 & 2` levels.

### Day 7 ote setup

In this section we will be looking for ote setup on GBPUSD as mentioned below.

**Daily timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day7-ote-1d.png">

As you can see the the price level which its trading its took out previous swing lows liquidty & but according to retailers mindset it has reached to support level so they will be looking for buy.

But we as ICT trader we can see there is liquidity area below the previous swing low which has not been taken out yet so price will move downwards for it.

**5m timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day7-ote-5m.png">

As we have bearish bias in our mind according to daily timeframe level we have marked previous day'w low for targetting it we will look for opportunity in our ote timezone which is `EST 8:30AM TO 11:00AM` which is `IST 6:00PM TO 8:30PM`.

We found ote setup inside our timeframe so we will be taking entry in ote retracements which are `62% to 79%` by keeping stoploss above swing high & we will be targetting `0,0.5,1 & 2 level` according to where previous day align in our tp levels.

### Day 8 OTE SETUP

In this section we will be looking for ote setup on GBPUSD as mentioned below.

**5m large range analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day8-ote-5m.png">

As we can see above we have marked our fridays high & sundays trading to get to know where our monday's trading has started.

We can see price had reversed in the monday's trading and we will be looking for bullish bias for targetting hte liquidity above friday's high.

**5m timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day8-ote-5m-2.png">

As we have bullish bias for taking out friday's high liquidity we will be looking for ote setup in our ote timezone which is `EST 8:30AM TO 11:00AM` which is `IST 6:00PM TO 8:30PM`.

we found the setup in our ote timezone so we will be taking entry in our ote retracement zone which is `62% to 79%` by keeping stoploss below swing low & keeping our target near around friday's high level. 

We did not expected price to reach out our tp levles all such as `0,0.5,1 & 2` because our setup is not based on fibs but we will be looking for fib levels around previous day's low & fib is just for reference.

### Day 9 OTE SETUP

In this section we will be looking for `EURAUD` as its not limited to selective pairs.

**5m timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day9-ote-5m.png">

We have marked monday's low on the chart & on tuesday `price came to it piereced it & reversed. does it mean the move had already happend? NO!!! Its called as shallow run means its not grabbed out the liquidity yet so it will come againt for the liquidity residing below that level`.

further ahead we are looking for ote pattern entry in ote timezone `EST 8:30AM TO 11:00AM` which is `IST 6:00PM TO 8:30PM` in ote retracement levels `62% to 79%`.

we found ote setup in our timezone so we took entry on `70.5%` by keeping stoploss above the swing high & targetting `0,0.5` levels only because those are the levels getting aligned with monday's daily low liquidity.

### Day 10 OTE SETUP

In this section we will be looking for `AUDUSD` pair as mentioned below.

<img src="./assets/ote/day10-ote-5m.png">

According to overview price has already reached to previous day's high in our timezone but still why we are looking for bullish entry is because it was shallow run as we have saw in previous session so price will go beyond that level for grabbing liquidity.

We have marked previous days high in the above chart in hte bullish enviornment so we will be looking for ote pattern in ote timezone `EST 8:30AM TO 11:00AM` which is `IST 6:00PM TO 8:30PM`.

we found entry in our timezone and price retraced to `62% to 79% ote retracement levels` so we will be taking entry by keeping stoploss below the swing low & targetting `0,0.5,1,1.5` because thats the nearest alligning range for liquidity area.


### Day 11 OTE SETUP

In this section we will be looking for OTE setup on `USDCAD` as mentioned below.

**5m timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day11-ote-5m.png">

We have marked the previous day high on the chart and we are looking for taking it out for liquidity according to our bullish bias.

We will be looking for ote setup in our ote timezone which is `EST 8:30AM TO 11:00AM` which is `IST 6:00PM TO 8:30PM` and we have found the setup where price is retracing in ote `62% to 79% retracement levels`.

We will be taking entry by keeping stoploss below swing low & targetting `0,0.5,1 & 2` as those levels are getting aligned with previous day's high liquidity area.


### Day 12 OTE

In this section we will be looking for OTE Setup in `mexican peso commodity futures`.

**5m timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day12-ote-5m.png">

As you can see we have marked wednsday's high on the chart & we are looking for taking out the liquidity resting above it.

we will be looking for ote setup in our ote timezone which is `EST 8:30AM TO 11:00AM` which is `IST 6:00PM TO 8:30PM` and we ahve found the setup where price is retraced in ote `62% to 79%` retracement levels.

We will be taking entry by keeping stoploss below swing low & targetting `0,0.5,1` but because 1 is nearest level above previous day high liquidity area.

### Day 13 OTE

In this section we will be looking USDCAD for ote setup for bearish scenario as mentioned below.

**5m timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day13-ote-5m.png">

On the daily timeframe USDCAD was bullish but it was having ote setup on daily due to which it was retracing, retailers might think market has reversed but market is just giving the retracement.

As we are analyzing 5m chart we will be looking for setp in our ote timezone which is `EST 8:30AM TO 11:00AM` which is `IST 6:00PM TO 8:30PM` and we have found the setup for downside move and price has retracedin in our ote `62% TO 79%` retracement levels.

We will be taking entry by keeping stoploss above the swing high & we will be targetting `0,0.5,1,1.5` levels as those are nearest level for the liquidity resting below previous day low.

### Day 14 OTE SETUP

In this section we will be looking GBPUSD for ote setup for bearish scenario as mentioned below.

**5m timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day14-ote-5m.png">

We have marked previous day low & we are looking for taking out liquidity below the previous day low.

We will be looking for setup in our ote timezone `EST 8:30AM TO 11:00AM` which is `IST 6:30PM to 8:00PM` and price retraced in our ote levels which are `62% TO 79%` but we need to be selective about setup where you are having clarity and no muddyness in it.

we will be taking entry by keeping stoploss above swing high & we will be targetting for `0,0.5,1` levles as they are nearest to previous day low liquidity area.

### Day 15 OTE SETUP

In this section we will be looking for ote setup on AUDUSD as mentioned below.

**5m timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day15-ote-5m.png">

We have marked our current day opening at `EST 12:00AM` in the chart & we will be looking for price movment to takeout liquidity resting above preivous day high .

We will be looking for setup in our ote timezone `EST 8:30AM TO 11:00AM` which is `IST 6:00PM TO 8:30PM` and price retraced in our ote `62% to 79% retracement levels`.

We will be taking entry keeping stoploss below swing low & we will be targetting `0,0.5,1,1.5,2` levels as the nearest levels till the nearest to previous day high liquidity.

**Second Opportunity :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day15-ote-5m2.png">

We got one more opportunity in our ote timezone as we discussed in the above section.

We took entry in our retracement levels by keeping stoploss below swing low & targetting for `0,0.5,1,1.5` but price went till only `0.5` & reversed from it.

Now you will ask why it didnt worked and all but this kind of scenario happens in the market where even if everything looks perfect market can go against our expectaions.

But we are in still profits because we set our partial profits on `0,0.5` levels and we have shifted our stoploss to brakeeven after hitting our first tp level which is `0` so at the end of the day we are still profitable according to our trading plan & rules.

### Day 16 OTE SETUP

In this section we will be looking on CRUDEOIL & for longer term ote setup.

**Daily timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day16-ote-1d.png">

In the above image you can see we have marked the gap high & gap low and also so called resistance level of retail traders.

Whenever any gap happens in the market its acts like an magnet, price will wants to trade in that zone for the liquidity so according to that prespective we have bullish bias for price running into gap zone & liquidy above it

**5m timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day16-ote-5m.png">

On the charts we have marked previous day high & we will be looking for bullish ote setup our ote timezone which is `EST 8:30AM TO 11:00AM` which is `IST 6:00PM TO 8:30PM` and we found setup where price retraced in our ote levels which are `62% to 79% retracement levels`.

we took entry by keeping stoploss below swing low & we will be targetting `0,0.5,1,1.5,2` levels as its nearest to previous day liquidity area.

It also went till retrailers daily timeframe resistance level & also it will rise up till the gap area liquidity but the move will be over the period of the time.

### Day 17 OTE SETUP

In this section we will be lookinf for OTE Setup on GBPUSD as mentioned below.

**1d timeframe :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day17-ote-1d.png">

On the chart we have marked the retail resistance levle where equal highs are there, for taking out that level liquidity price will draw towards that level which is called as draw on liquidity.

We have also marked fridays high because according to our bias for resistance level liquidity price is likely to move higher.

**5m timeframe :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day17-ote-5m.png">

The red line marked on chart is the fridays high but according to higher timeframne analysis we are expecting price to draw towards resistance liquidy so we will be targetting levels above that friday's high.

We will be looking setup in ote timezone which is `EST 8:30AM TO 11:00AM` which is `IST 6:00PM TO 8:30PM` in which we found the entry where price retraced in ote `62% to 79% retracement levels`.

We will be taking entry by keeping our stoploss below the swing low & we will be targetting `0,0.5,1,1.5,2` levels as we are expecting price move higher than fridays high.

### Day 18 OTE  SETUP

In this section we will be looking for OTE setup on tresury futures bond as ote setup is not limited to forex.

**1d timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day18-ote-1d.png">

On the daily timeframe as you can see price given otpimal trade entry to donwside and there are equal lows as well below the previous day so we will be looking for previous day low's liquidity taken out.

There is possiblity that price can go even more lower because of the liquidity resting below equal lows so we can target even lower than previous day low.

**5m timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day18-ote-5.png">

According to our daily bias we was looking to take out previous day liquidity, and we have marked previous day low & equal lows from daily timeframe on the chart.

We will be looking for entry in our ote timezone which is `EST 8:30AM TO 11:00M` TO `IST 6:00PM TO 8:30PM` and we found the entry where price retraced in `62% TO 79%` retracement levels.

We will be taking entry by keeping stoploss above the swing high & we will be targetting for `0,0.5,1,1.5,2` levels as those are aligning with previous day low liquidity & equal lows liquidity from daily charts.

### Day 19 OTE SETUP

In this section we will be having look on USDJPY for ote setup as mentioned below.

**5m timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day19-ote-5m.png">

As you can see we have marked previous day high & also other equal highs are getting aligned in that range so we will be expecting for taking out that liquidity according to our bias.

<img src="./assets/ote/day19-ote-5m2.png">

We will be looking for entry in our ote timezone which is `EST 8:30AM TO 11:00AM` which is `IST 6:00PM TO 8:30PM` in which we got the entry where price have retraced in our ote `62% to 79% retracement levels`.

We will be taking entry by keeping stoploss below the swing low & we will be targetting for `0,0.5,1,1.5` as they align in our liquidtiy area of previous day swing high.

### Day 20 OTE SETUP

In this section we will be looking for ote setup on EURUSD as mentioned below.

**5m timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/ote/day20-ote-5m.png">

As you can see we have marked previous day high which we already took out in new york opening run but we might get disappointed that we have missed the move.

But no it was the only price level & according to daily average move liquidity resides above of those level which price targets so we can still take entry.

We will be looking for setup in ote timezone which is `EST 8:30AM TO 11:00AM` which is `IST 6:00PM TO 8:30AM`, we found entry where price has retraced into  `62% to 79% retracement levels`.

We will be taking entry by keeping stoploss below previous swing low & we will be targetting for `0,0.5,1` as it aligns with previous day swing high.


# 2022 Mentorship

In this mentorship we will be going to learn the the setups & frameworks which does not appear daily but every week for sure from which you can make you profits by consistantly trading those setups.

### Buy Stops & Sell Stops

**Buy Stops :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/buy-stops.png">
On tha chart whereever there are swing high's above that buy stops resides which means stop orders of buy positions.

**Sell Stops :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/sell-stops.png">
ON the chart whereever there are swing low's below that sell stops resides which means stop orders of sell positions.

### Elements to trade Setup

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s2-weekly-direction.png">

**Direction of Weekly Range  :-**

On the very first place we will be having look on weekly chart.

According to seasonal tendencies, intrest rates, earning seasons volatility and other technical parameters we will be checking out what will be the expected direction of weekly range, we will not be predicting its close nor if its gonna reach out to liquidy levels in single week itself but we will be purely looking for expected direction of weekly range.

**Daily Range :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s2-daily-range.png">

Majority of trading and our analysis will be going to be on daily timeframe.

We need to check where we are on our current daily candle in terms of weekly big picture, and according our weekly direction currently price should be expected to taking out swing lows and reracing into `imbalance`.

  **Imbalance :-**

  <img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s2-imbances.png">

  Imbalance is one single candle braking out swing high's or breaking down swing low's and nothing overlapping that candles range in opposite direction as mentioned in the image above.

**Hourly analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s2-hourly-range.png">

As you can see we have marked weekly range from monday's opening `EST 12:00` which is `IST 9:30AM` on monday & we have marked our current day's friday's daily range from its openning & till its closing.

As we have anticipated the lower direction price has dropped drastically till thursday & price went into consolidation on friday as we are pointing towards it in the image above.

You can notice what happened into our consolidation is that price took out sell side liquidity and buy side liquidity after it before moving downside which is called as `inducement` which means price took out sellers who had sell stops near previous low & and took out buyers after that by hitting buy side liquidity which is called as engineering liquidity prior to big price move.

Anytime if we are expecting price to move higher it will first give false move to downside by taking out sell side liquidity and vice versa about when we are expecting move lower it will first it will give flase move to upside for taking out buy side liquidy and then only it moves in the expected directions and thats how the price delivery algorithm works.

**15m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s2-15m-view.png">

On our 15m timframe we have marked the buy side & sell side liquidity to keep our focus on the our bias and its clarity.

As we had discussed earlier price first triggerd sell stop orders resting below sell side liquidity of brake out artist retail sellers & also hit their stoploss by taking out buy side liquidity and which triggered buy stop orders resting above buy side liquidity of retail brakeout artist traders and took them out by moving downside according to our higher timeframe premise.

To find something specific at the draw on liquidtiy buy stops we will be jumping on lower timeframe charts.

**2m chart :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s2-2m-view.png">

why a 2m chart because 5m has lot of room to occur imbalances in it but `1m,2m,3m` charts are the best for finding imbalnces for indices, high frequency trading algorithms doesnt work more than 3m timeframes but they are looking for intervals in seconds.

High frequency trading algorithms looking for small little imbalances which means as mentioned below.

When we took out previous old high's on 15m timeframe we need to dropdown to lower timerframe in which price created short term low there and broke it down with single candle which we call `imbalance` as we have saw earlier.

The gap formed due to imbalance within first & second candle called as `Fair value Gap` and when price retraces to that fvg `thats where we need to SELL there.`

It occurs every single time atleast once a week the `FAIR VALUE GAP (FVG)` from where price retraces to our orignal direction after giving false move into fvg after break of structure.

We will be able to find and trade it smoothly after backtesting of weeks and months where price retraces in opposite direction into fair value gap and we need to build the trust for market selling when market going higher & buying when market going lower and that will only going to happen with backetesting.

**Premium & Discount zone :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s2-premium-discount.png">

On the previous swing when we mark the fibs `area lower than 50% level called as discount zone` & `area above 50% level called as premium zone`.

Price delivery algorihm delivers price from premium to discount zone according to higher timeframe direction and no matter how much opposite traders we bring from all world price delivery algorihm going to crush & squueze them because price delivery algorihm moves the price not the buying & selling pressure.

**Stoploss & Targets :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s2-sl-tp.png">

We will be keeping stoploss above swing high which broken by imbalance & we will be targetting nearest liqudity in discout zone.

Also if we can notice there is buyside imbalance residinng in that zone where price has delivered buy side balanced move & sell side move which is an example for efficient price delivery of the algorithm.

**Strategy based on Fair value gap :-**

- Run on liquidity
- Look for Buy stops to taken out in bullish enviornment
- Look for sell stops to be taken out in bearish enviornment
- Break of market structure for short term swing low or high
- While brake of structure if its creates gap
- when price retraces in that fair value gap take entry
- target nearest liquidity in the direction of your trade

**Excercise :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s2-excercise.png">

Go through emini futures intraday charts or forex charts & look for brake of structure where buy stops & sell stops have been taken in opposing direction of your weekly range.

Then we look for brake in market structure on lower timeframe once that occur & imbalance gets created thats our trigger of entry to take entry in that fvg targetting nearest liquidity below old high's or old low's or the imbalance.


### Internal Range Liquidity & Market Structure Shifts

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/mss.png">

Market Structure shift in terms of downtrend is when price brakes down equal lows in intraday enviornments such as `15m timeframe` in downtrending enviornments its likely to brake equal highs of that range as well in same day.

Market Structure shift in terms of uptrend is when price brakes out equal highs in in intraday enviornments such as `15m timeframe` uptrending enviornments its likely to brake equal lows of that range as well in same day.

**Bearish Market Structure Shift :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/mss-2.png">

As you can see above we need to keep note on follwing points.

- Stop raid on buy side liquidity.
- brakedown of recent swing low prior to stop raid/draw on liquidity.
- Wait patiently for candle after brakedown to close.
- Checkout if it created fair value gap with candle prior to brakeout & the candle next to brakeout.
- It if does take entry in retracement of fair value gap.
  
**Bullish Market Structure Shift :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/mss-2.png">

As you can see above we need to keep note on follwing points.

- Stop raid on sell side liquidity.
- brakeout of recent swing low prior to stop raid/draw on liquidity.
- Wait patiently for candle after brakeout to close.
- Checkout if it created fair value gap with candle prior to brakeout & the candle next to brakeout.
- It if does take entry in retracement of fair value gap.

**What is order block exactly?**
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/bearish-ob.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/bullish-ob.png">

Orderblock is change in state of price delivery algorithm which mean as you can see above for bearish orderblock, the opening price of candle from which the price started to go higher & higher as we are pointing towards it in above image, when that opening price is taken down then its called as state changed of price delivery algorithm from bullish to bearish & after that it will be looking for & attacking sell stops  & sell stops  as its offering sell side liquidity.

As you can see for bullish orderblock, then opening price of candle from which the price started to go lower & lower as we are pointing towards in it in above image, when that opening price is taken out then its called as state changed of price delivery algorithm from bearish to bullish & after that it will be looking for & attacking buy stops & buy stops as its offering buy side liquidity.


**Applications of Market structure shifts :-**
We can look for below sessions & their high's and low's because market can sweep above those high's & sweep above those low's so we can look for out market structure shift with fvg setup in it.

1. Looking for London Session high's & low's `EST 2:00AM TO 5:00AM` which is `IST`.

2. Looking for New york session high's & low's `EST 7:00AM TO 10:00AM` which is `IST`.

3. Looking for Asian session high's & low's `EST 7:00PM TO 9:00PM` which is `IST`.
   
4. Any intraday high & low before equity openings before `EST 9:30AM` which is `IST`


**Internal Range Liquidity :-**

Looking for short term low's & short term high's inside a price inside which we are retracing into leg is called as `Internal Range Liquidity`.

Liquidity is short term high's or low's stops above or below or an imbalance.

**Excercise :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s3-homework.png">

Go through Emini futures intraday charts and look for stop hunts that leads to market structure shifts in the market `on 3m,2m,1m timeframes` between `EST 8:30AM TO 12:00AM` & fvg entry setup with those.

### Exaples for Market structure shifts & internal range liquidity

**E-MINI S&P 500:-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s4-equilibrium.png">

As you can see we have marked the `fib 50% level` from extreme low which we marked with blue & extreme high which we also marked with blue.

We have marked 50% equilibrium which is red & another swing low with blue for the liquidity above that we have imbalance as well so that would be our valid exit point.

**Setup :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s4-eimini-setup.png">

As you can see price first took out the buy side liquidity and given market structure shift to recent or intermediate low

When price given bearish market structure shift it formed a fair value gap for which we was looking for & we will be taking entry by `targetting previous swing low liquidity or imbalance or 50% retracement`  by keeping stoploss above the Fair value gap.


**E-MINI NASDAQ-100 :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s4-nasdaq-setup.png">

As you can see we have marked the equilibrium of extreme swing high & low, buy side liquidity & also we found an imbalance which can acts as our take profit level.

We can see price first took out buy side liquidity and given market structure shift to recent or intermediate swing low.

When price given bearish market structure shift we will be looking for fair value gap and we found one so we will be taking entry by `targetting previous swing's low liquidity, equilibrium & imbalance as our take profit levels`.

### Intraday order flow & understanding the daily range.

For forex we need to mark out the timezones which are `EST 8:30AM TO 12:00PM` which is `IST 6:00PM TO 9:30PM` & `EST 1:00PM TO 4:00PM` which is `IST 10:30PM TO 1:30AM` and the 1h gap between this timezones will be lunch brake we need to avoid that.

`NO TRADE TIME is  EST 12:00PM TO 1:00PM which is IST 9:30PM TO 10:00PM`.

**Which levels to took for stop hunt according to our setup :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s5-15m.png">

We look for equal lows & equal high's forming prior to `EST 8:30AM` which is `IST 6:00PM` on `15m timeframe` around our trading timeframe in morning session & afternoon session as we have saw above.

After we able mark the buy stops & sell stops for stop hunt zone we switch to lower timeframe chart which is `5m`. If price is having small small moves against the level that could possibly respect the level but if price is moving agressively towards the level there is posiblity of piercing that level.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s5-5m.png">

After price reaches to the level either it respects or pierces we look for `MSS` with strong `displacement :- strong move into opposite side after reaching certain level` then only it can form fair value gap as we have mentioned in the above image.

**Price move in morning & afternoon :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s5-moves.png">

We consider our new york trading in 2 sessions, the morning session `EST 8:30AM TO 12:00PM & IST 6:00PM TO 9:30PM` & afternoon session as `EST 1:00PM TO 4:00PM & IST 10:30 TO 1:30AM` .

In the above image as you cam see once price took out sell stops according to our `MSS + FVG setup` now price will be taking down buy stops liquidity accoridng to higher timeframe direction.

But notice price didn't pierced the buy side liquidity so retailsers will short considering it as resistance but price is consolidating and making higher high's slowly which is indicating that price is likely to move higher.

You can notice how price has moved drastically in the afternoon session at the timing of new york session closing which is   `EST 3:00PM TO 4:00PM & IST 12:30 TO 1:30AM` and at this timing price likely to make its close of the day so in the timepeior it will either breaks high of previous day in bullish enviornment & low of the previous day in bearish enviornment.

As you can see we price had blown out an swing low in afternoon session and our bias is bullish so we can take entry on that draw on liquidity targetting for next buy side liquditiy. We don't need multiple setups in the market to trade 1-2 setups can fullfill our profitability so `MSS + FVG` & `run on liquidtiy of opposite side of daily range expansion` are the enough entrypoints in a day.

`NOTE :- Dont try to get into little moves with huge contracts or lotsize and that's not our goal but try to catch the big moves in the day selectectively and thats what we are learning for. Once you get the move of day in morning or evening session dont trade on live account and practice on demo account and dont give the money back to market once you earned by trading live account in day.`

### Market Efficiency Paradigm & Institutional Order Flow

**How to we internalize price delivery :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/internalize-price-delivery.png">

- Do not trade patterns sake
- Do not trade indicator readings or momentum
- We look to enter longs where retail sells
- We look to enter shorts where retail buys
- We antcipate price seeking opposing liquidity
- Time of day is vital when engaging with price
- Do not trade patterns sake

**Market Structure Shift :-**

Market structure shift is when price cotinuing in some direction from some previous swings keep braking swing points eihter high's or low's and suddenly it moves strongly into opposite direction which causes breakout or brakedown of previous swing level and closes the candle below that swing point.


**Bearish Market Structure shifts :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/bearish-mss.png">

Bearish Market structure shift is valid when price had previously broken swing high in last swing or it took out buy side liquidity & price displaces strongly to downside due to which intermediate or last swing low get broken. 

Candle should be closed below the broken down swing low & displacement area should be wider. In the displacement high & displacement low High probability bearish FVG forms & Every single day this pattern occurs either in one or other market.

**Bullish Market Structure shifts :-**

Bullish Market structure shift is valid when price had previously broken swing low in last swing or it took out sell side liquidity & price displaces strongly to upside due to which intermediate or last swing high get broken. 

Candle should be closed above the broken out swing high & displacement area should be wider. In the displacement high & displacement low High probability bearish FVG forms & Every single day this pattern occurs either in one or other market.

**THE ICT FAIR VALUE GAP :-**

Fair value gaps are the gap occured while run above or below previous low and the third candles continues the same direction of breakout candle but does not trade towards the first candle's low to which we given brakeout.

Fair value gaps are basically the area where price is not delivered efficiently which means lets consider we are painting the wall with paint roller and when we are rolling from top to bottom what happens? it leaves out spots or unefficiently painted areas so what we do to fix that? we need to roll to its opposite side to fix that. Its the same with Fair value gap, when price is not delievered in some area efficiently it drives towards it to delivers price efficiently.

As we know smart money buys when retailers sell & sells when retailers buy, lets consider if price given brakeout to resistance level retail brakeout artist will enter into market but smart money wants to sell their as its an stop hunt or taking out the liquidity resting about that buy stops, if smart money misses that move its an second opportunity for smart money to enter into the trade in the fair value gap and it works as smooth as expected.

**Bearish Fair value Gap :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/bearish-fvg.png">

Bearish fair value gaps are only valid if price took out liquidity resting above the buy stops & then it creates strong bearish displacement which is strong downside move which brakes down previous candles or swing low and if the next candle continues bearishness which creates gap then its an valid fair value gap.

Basically the bearish fvg occured after bearish market structure shift are the valid fair value gaps.

**Bullish Fair value Gap :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/bullish-fvg.png">

Bullish fair value gaps only valid if price took out liquidity resting below sell stops & then it creates strong bullish displacement which is strong upside move which brakes out previous candles high and if the next candle continuesx bullishness which creates gap then its an valid fair value gap.

Basically the bullish fvg occured after bullish market structure shift are the valid fair value gaps.

**Setup with fvg & mss :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s6-15m.png">

As you can see we have marked our morning session which is `EST 8:30AM TO 12:00PM & IST 6:00PM TO 9:30PM` & we found that swing high formed before `EST 8:30AM & IST 6:00`
and we will be referring for it.

As you can see price take out that high & buy side liquidity resting there now we will be looking for our `MSS + FVG` setup for which we will be continuing to look lower timeframes such as `5m, 3m, 1m` every timeframe till `1m`.

**5m timeframe :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s6-5m.png">

As we can see we are not able to see any fair value gap.

**3m timeframe :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s6-3m.png">

As you can see we are able to find fair value gap there on 3m timeframe on which we can take entry by targetting previous swing levels liquidity & keeping stoploss above the last swing high.

**2m timeframe :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s6-2m.png">

As you can see we are able to find fair value gap there on 2m timeframe which is same we saw on 3m timeframe on which we can take entry by targetting previous swing levels liquidity & keeping stoploss above the last swing high.

**1m timeframe :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s6-1m.png">

As you can see we are able to find the first occurance of fair value gap on 1m timeframe the very fine tuned one which is above than 3m timeframe setup but this 1m setup will be the best possible entry out there.

We will be entering on that fair value gap by targetting previous swing levels liquidity & buy keeping stoploss above the last swing high.

**Booking profits using liquidity :-**

As we have discussed previously we have 2 types of liquidity which are internal range & external range liquidity.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s6-liquidity.png">

As you can see above we have mareked fib on swing high to low in which we got the setup so the liquidity resting inside 0 to 100% retracement its called as internal range liquidity that can be `buy/sell stops, imbalance or fvg etc`.

We need to book our partials inside the liquidity range & we have to close our trade on external liquidity.

### Daily Bias & Consolidation hurdles

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s7-daily-bias.png">

As you can see we are able to see the daily chart for `NASDAQ`in which we price recently took down swing lows liquidity in upper swing, formed fair value gap & targeted sell side liquidity, if we would be in between the move which is occuring we would be looking for sell setups untill & unless price reaches to the sell side liquidity, but you can there was some bullish days as well.

We cant be expect to `being 100% accurate & perfect` in the market or getting to know bias every single day, but you can see the majority of the move was in our bias direction so we are in profit overall even after having 2 bullish days but we had 4 bearish days accoridng to our bias.

Now after the above mentioned move what we are expecting is that price should retrace into preimum zone which is above 50% of the recent swing to upside & we went down to previous low & bounced back from it, At the current stage our direction is not clear enough, even ICT sometimes does not have clear idea about the bias, in that case we need more price action and more information based on whats market going to do right after the morning `EST 9:30AM & IST 7:00PM`, in such cases we look for intraday price action after `EST 8:30AM & IST 6:00PM` for taking out equal high's & low's forming & our setup `MSS + FVG`.

We was expecting price to take liquidity formed equal low's formed on previous swing levels & we will be hunting setups by keeping our bias in our mind. we can take setups counter of our bias such as bullish but we need to be conservative about the leaverage & risk to minimum but when setup occurs in the favors of our bias we go maximum leaverage upto `3.5% of equity` but we as a beginner trader we should be trade maximum to `1%, 0.5%` of our equitiy.


**15m (Intraday) analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s7-intraday.png">

As you can see even though we was expecting downmove according to our foggy daily bias we have marked `EST 8:30AM & IST 6:00PM` on the chart & price took out the swing low in our morning session, so we would be switching to smaller timeframes such as `5,3m,2m,1m` timeframe for looking our `FVG` in `between the displacement high & low`.

**2m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s7-2m.png">

As you can see we have switched to 2m timeframe looking for `FVG` in between the displacement high & low, As you can see we are not able to see the `FVG` but still ICT took entry when price took sell side liquidity mentioned in the above image.

BUT WHY???

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s7-emini-fvg.png">

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s7-smt.png">

Because Fair value gap formed on `S&P 100` which is co-relative pair to `NASDAQ` & there was an `SMT` divergence as well been caught by ICT as mentioned above in the image.

ICT took entry by targetting nearest liqudity & imbalnce till which price can move wihtout any hurdles.


**Overcoming consolidation hurdles :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s7-consolidation-hurdles.png">

As you can see there are lot of short term orders on ICT's live account before our actual entry which we saw above & Why is that?

Back in the 90's ict learnt from floor trader who traded s&p on actual floor & larry williams & george & gails, and what is that? when this people would not be having clarity about the price action they would just simply buy or sell with very little quantity to analyze whats market willing to do.

Is market running away from the entry price is either direction or its just keep going higher & lower and it will gives us the clarity about the market direction, and whatever loss or profit we will fact due to it will be premium to the market to get the clarity about the direction. sometimes we get profits as well & also losses from it but it would be for our clarity purpsoe which would be valid & how price delivering to that order.

If price is going in the direction of your bias it seems to be our bias correct but if its not then ther is sign that our bias seems not be strong enough & the direction is not getting respected.

### Applying Institutoinal flow to forex markets

In this section we will be looking on `EURJPY` for our `MSS + FVG` setup to checkout if it works fine in forex pairs & if does it work on daily timeframes.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s8-daily.png">

As you can see price took out sell side liqudity & given bullish market structure shift but not created any `fvg` in it & again it took out previous swing low & given an  bullish market structrue shift.

Now in this occurance we found our `FVG` inside displacement high & low so we will be taking entry into it by keeping stoploss below swing or displacement low & we will be targetting nearest buy side liquidity or an imbalance.

**Current day 15m & 5m analysis  :-**
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s8-15m.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s8-5m.png">

We have marked `EST 7:00AM TO 10:00AM & IST 4:30PM TO 7:30PM` which is new york kill zone for forex market.

As you can see in the above image we took out sell side liquidity residing below the swing low over there but we are not able to see any fair value gap in it, so we will be switching to lower timeframes as `5m,3m,2m,1m` untill we find our fvg entry.

**3m timeframe :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s8-3m.png">

As we can see we are able to find `FVG` between displacement high & low on 3m timeframe on which we will be taking entry by keeping stoploss below displacement low.

But now how we will be setting target for this forex entry, if we move to higher timefrmae we will be able to see something like liquidity resting above buy stops but we can use the fibs as well according to our OTE configuration and we can target `1,1.5,2` levels according to buy stops & liquidity.

**Approach for london session for forex :-**

We can look for  `EST 2:00AM TO 5:00AM & IST 11:30PM TO 2:30PM` for london setup in which we can look for `MSS + FVG` setup for london trading paris such as `EURUSD, GBPUSD etc`


### Power of 3 &  New york PM Session Opportunities

In this section we will be understanding power of 3 and new york session opportunities.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s9-Daily.png">

In the above image we can see price took out previous swing low liquidity resting below buy stops & currenty price traded in discount zone & price took down recent swing low & buy stops resting below that and created fair value gap & on the current day we are retraing into that fair value gap.

**Power of 3 on intradya 15m timeframe :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s9-15m.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s9-m.png">


Power of 3 means `Accumulation, Manipulation & Distributoin` as we have already learned in previous series.

In our current section you can see we have marked `EST 8:30AM & IST 6:00PM` session opening and before that there are buy stops residing above the equal low's & After morning session opening price took out that buy side liquidity & created an  fair value gap.

We consider our session opening time price as opening price of the day in the phase of `AMD (Accumulation Manipulation & Distribution)` and price consolidated which we will be considering `Accumulation` & you can notice when price retraced into that fair value gap it took down the opening price as it was `Manipulation` phase of the day and when price given its orignal move for taking previous day high liquidity & for retrcacing in `daily timeframe fair value gap`.


**1m timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s9-1m.png">

As you can see on 1m timeframe we have took out swing high & created a fair value gap in our afternoon trading session. 

When price will be retracing into that fair value gap price is also retracing in order-block, inside the retracement which gives us high probability buyside entry and we can target for our recent swing high's & buy stops residing above it.


**What if bigger move happens overnight ?**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s9-overnight-5m.png">

If price moves a larger or bigger range overnight withint `EST 2:00AM TO 5:00AM & IST 11:30AM TO 2:30AM` then we should not expect larger range move in new york session.

Whenever price moves in larger range and it creates low as we can see above around our morning opening session which is `EST 8:30AM & IST 6:00PM` and most of the retail traders stop loss will be resting below that because they want to preserve their profits.

As we can see as soon as price took out that swing low & stops redsiding below that it rallyed to the level of daily timeframe fair value gap.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s9-overnight-1m .png">

If we switch to lower timeframe for looking for FVG + MSS setup we dont have it when price took down previous swing lows but we got the clarity that price will be rallying upside & we found one setup in the after noon session where we was having bullish bias we will be taking entry by keeping stoploss below the swing level & we will be targetting nearest liquidity.

### Implementing Economic Calender Events with open

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s10-economic-cal.png">

**Link :-** `https://www.forexfactory.com/`

Economic calender is the calender for economic news events which can bring huge volatile movements which can destroy your trades unexpectedly, so we need to be aware about the news which can impact our market, our trades & will it be in positive way or negative way.

Yellow stands for low impact, orange stands for medium & red stands for high impact news in the chart.

The reason we choose our morning session starting at morning `EST 8:30 & IST 6:00` is due to number of news get released at that timing & its starting of news release.

**Power of 3 :-**
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s10-1d.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s10-1d-ohlc.png">

As you can see in the candlesticks chart we can see price took out previous long term swing lows & retraced into recent swing discounted zone, and in teh recent times price took out previous swing lows & created `MSS + FVG` setup and we will be looking for price to move downside taking out the sell stops resting below the previous swing low's.

Now Power of 3 means `ACCUMULATION, MANIPULATION & DISTRIBUTION` as we have see above in other mentorship sessions but in this session we get to learn that all the setups in the direction of our daily bias happens in the opening range.

So what does the opening range means, opening range is the range from where price creates false move & high /low of the day we draw the same area of range to its opposite side as well, the range from opening price to the manipulation move is called as opening range & all the possible patterns or entries happens in the opening range according to your daily bias.

Once we have bias on the daily timeframe we stick to that bias untill & unless we reach out to liquidity area where price is heading and we take same direction trades, some trades will be wrong but most of teh days will in the pattern of power of 3 where after accumulation price will create false move as opening range & will expand to bias side & creates the high/low of the day according to bias and we will going to trade bias direction in it.

**1h anaysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s10-1h.png">

Above we have zoomed into the area from daily timeframe where the `MSS + FVG` formed & red lines are the `fvg high & fvg low` & Green areas marked on the charts are the fvg's from the session 9 where we was expecting bullish move to retrace into that daily timeframe fvg.

Price retraced to that fvg & created our `MSS + FVG` setup after rembalancing price to that fvg & that entry is formed in london sessoin, if we have clarity about the daily bias we get innormus amount of entries in london session & our `FVG + MSS setup works in all sessions london, asian & new york` but as there is not greater move in asian session we can focus on london & new york session.


**15m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s10-15m.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s10-15m-po3.png">
<img src ="./assets/2022-mentorship/s10-15m-3.png">

As you can see in the fist image we are able to see how price is retracing in our fvg from 1h as we have saw above.

In the second image you can see we have marked our new york midnight open which is `EST 12:00AM & IST 9:30AM` in the london session price took created day high & retraced into fvg from daily timeframe and there are 2-3 things alighning, first is price retracing in fvg, second is its creating day high in london & thats how we find high probability trades where multiple confluences are getting aligned with each other.

As we have discussed about the opening range we are able to see the multiple entries on 15m timeframe in the opening range which is the daily high/low area drawn on both side.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s10-4m.png">

As you can see according to our analysis above we will be looking down to smaller timeframes for looking for `MSS + FVG` setup and we have found that on 4m timeframe.

Once we find the setup on any lower timeframe, we dont go more down or analysis more timeframes, we optimally look for setup on that same timeframe and we will be planning entry for it.

as we can see price has retraced into that fvg after MSS due to which we will be taking entry in that fvg & we will be targetting nearest liquidity resting below sell stops by keeping stoploss above the recent swing high.

### Missing setups & Coping with it

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s11-1d.png">

As you can see in the above chart price took out the liquidity below sell stops of previous swing low & reversed into bullish direction, But failed to take out liquidity resting above buy stops of recent swing high.

But it broken down previous swing high creating `MSS + FVG` setup & imbalance range dut to which we will be expecting price taking down liquidity resting below previous swing low & sell stops on daily timeframe.

`Note :- If you are looking for whole daily range you consider EST 12:00 & IST 9:30AM as opening price but if you are looking for morning session then you prefer EST 8:30 & IST 6:00PM as the opening price.`

**Lower Timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s11-1h.png">

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s11-15m.png">

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s11-5m.png">

According to daily timeframe bias we price is heading downside as its retraced into daily bearish `MSS + FVG` setup.

As you can see on the 5m chart mentioned above we are able to see our bearish `MSS + FVG` setup for wich we have marked the imbalance or fvg & we will be looking into that setup on lower timeframes.

**4m timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s11-4m.png">

we are focusing on the fvg area which we able to caught on 5m timeframe for fine tuning.

As you can see after giving bearish market structure shift to previous swing price retracing in that fair value gap formed while market structure shift & we will be taking entry when price will retracing into the fvg.

**3m timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s11-3m.png">

The candle we are pointing on this chart thats where we took the entry to our short entry.

Why that specific candle? Because firstly we had bearish bias form the higher timeframe & on the 5m timeframe price created bearish `MSS + FVG` setup but we was waiting for the entry. on the candle `10:33` you can notice price was the in the fair value gap displacement high &  nearest to its recent swing high which would be best case scenario to entry because as price is in bearish movment its not likely to brake out that high.

Once we enter into the trade & price strongly displaced to downside and caused market structure shift to downside which was a good sign that price wants to get away from that level & we just need to sit & relax until our trade hits tp.

We have took entry on that 10:33 candle by targetting the liduitity area which we have marked wiht green line on the chart by keeping stoploss on fvg entry swing high & if our `MSS + FVG` repeats we can add the position into the trade.

### Market Structure for precision technician

In this section we will be focusing on market structure from higher timeframe to lower timeframe step by step braking it down.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s12-1d.png">

`How do it know price will not brakeout previous high & i should get short on highest high?`

Very first thing we need to understand is that whenever we are approaching to charts our view should be what is the price doing exactly, will likely to go high for taking out liquidity resting above buy/sell stops or price heading for balancing the bearish or bearish `FVG/Imbalance` simple as that, We get an raw bias based on that.

Let's switch to hourly timeframe for deep dive into market structure.

**1h timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s12-1h.png">

You can see the red lines marked on the chart are the high & low of daily range fair value gap on which we are having bearish bias.

Now here we have marked `Long term high/low (LTH, LTL)`, `Intermediate term high/low (ITH,ITL)` & `Short term high/low (STH,STL)` and what we will be be noticing Long term high & Intermediate term high should not be taken out as we are having bearish bias in the mind.

You can notice when price touched fair value gap high & then came down to fair value gap low notice in second swing price created intermediate term hihg by not braking long term high & broken short term low and created intermediate term low with strong bearish movement which caused another fair value gap on 1h timeframe.

Now we will be focuing on price while retracing into fair value gap after giving bearish market structure shift as an orderblock & as soon as it failes to brake intermediate term high & brakes down short term low over there with strong rejection that draws our intrest in there.

why because price retraced into fair value gap expecting bearish move & it also failed to brake intermediate term high which is another confirmation of its willingness to go downside & its bearish ness.

Lets have look in our focused area on lower timeframe.

`Note :- Our only conslusion form this market structure is that the swing point created while price rebalancing in imbalance or retracing in fair value gap it shold not be taken out at any cost even after your entry until the exit, if it does then its an wrong trade and you need to accept the loss if it hit your SL.`

`Note :- And another objetive we wanted to deliver in this was when the move is upside the downclose or bearish candles which appears in between will acts as support & should not be taken down & when the move is bearish upside close or bullish candles acts as resistance & should not be taken out.`

**15m timeframe :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s12-15m.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s12-15m-entries.png">

As you can see the orange marked area in our 15m chart is the bearish orderblock move of 1h, and look closely what does reside in? `The Fair Value Gap`. when the fair value gap occurs inside the order block its in high probability indication and the entry with multiple confluences.

We can take entry over there by keeping our daily bias in mind for bearish ness due to bearish `MSS + FVG` setup, we will be targetting liquidity from daily timeframe itself.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s12-15m-fibs.png">

How we get to know what levels should we target for is based on the fibs, we can draw the fibs from the `LTL to ITH` from which actual down move started and we will get the levels such as `0,0.5,1,1.5,2,2.5 & 3 according to ICT fib setting as mentioned above` but we need to checkout which fib level getting aligning with sell side liquidity from daily chart? that is `1.5` so we will be targettig `1.5` level after this entry as an exit of trade & dont forget to book the partial profits on `0,0.5,1` as it increases the probability of the trade to become profitable.

**5m timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s12-5m.png">

We have saw 2 entries on the 15m timeframe which was aggresive & low risk high probability trade in it.

We have dropped down on 5m timeframe analysis in which you can see our aggresive entry previously didnt broken any swing low while creating fair value gap on 15m timeframe but you can see it does on 5m timeframe which is another confirmation for that entry.

Also we can see micro view for low risk high probability entry as well in which we are able to see clearly how bearish market structure shift occured on 5m timeframe for that setup & how cleanly price respected that fair value gap & moved drastically downside according to our daily bias.

### Market Structure for precision technician Execution

According to our learning in previous section we will be seeing those things in the action in this session.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s13-1d.png">

As you can see after the move we saw in previous section price had already took out the liquidity resting below the previous swing lows but it also caused the market structure shift & created the fair value gap.

So at the current stage there can be possibility that price will attract towards that fair value gap or imbalance to balance the price & can continue its bearish rally.

**1h timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s13-1h.png">

By keeping our daily bias in mind we are able to see recently price given market structure shift to its previous swing high but not created fair value gap.

But we are able to see price retracing in the downclose candle prior to the move which is an order block and also acting as an support for us according to theory in the previous section.

When price is retracing in that orderblock of 1h timefrmae what time its retracing matters also price will be retracing in the imbalance or fair value at that point on the lower timeframe.

Lets switch out to the lower timeframe for seeing into that area in more details.

**15m timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s13-15m.png">

As we have predicted there is an imbalance inside the order block which makes it high probability setup by keeping bullish bias in the mind from daily timefrme.

Now you can see our 1h timefrmae orderblock is became of 2 candles on 15m timeframe along with some other candles so its never an single candle prior to move its an series of candle before the move.

Price has retraced into that order block once around `EST 6:30AM & IST 4:00PM` but as we said it what time of the day its occuring also matters.

According to our plan & morning session timings after `EST 8:30AM & IST 6:00PM` we got another retracement into that order block & fair value gap inside it and thats where we look for the entry.

Lets fine tune it by looking it on lower timeframes.

**5m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s13-5m.png">

We have focused in the area where price retraced into order block & fair value gap of higher timeframe where we found entry from 15m timeframe `MSS + FVG` setup.

Now you can see there is another order block formed on 5m timefrmae & also it created an fair value gap in which we will be taking entry by keeping stop loss below that swing low & we will be targetting the liquidity resting above the level we have marked with red line on the chart.

`Note :- As we have learned in the bullish move downclose or bearish candle should support the price as orderblock so whenever price retraced into order block & MSS + FVG setup after our entry till we havent reached our liquidity level we can add more position in our trade.`

### Multiple Setups in trading sessions

In this session we will be discussing & focusing about multiple setups in morning session `EST 8:30AM TO 12:00PM & IST 6:00PM TO 9:30PM` & afternoon session `EST 1:00PM TO 4:00PM & IST 10:30 TO 1:30AM`.

**1d analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s16-1d.png">

As you can see on the daily timeframe price has tookout buyside liquidity & retracing in bearish orderblock.

Let's switch to lower timeframe for more details.

**1h analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s16-1h.png">

On the 1h timefrmae we are having look on power of 3 in which we are expecting downside move for the price according to our daily timeframe as price as retracing in orderblock from daily timeframe.

There are multiple reasons getting aligned with each other for price going to the dpwnside which are liquidity resting below equal lows form previous swing levels & also there is daily timeframe order block over there.

`How much down we can go beyond that order block level? for that lets switch to lower timeframe.`

**15m timeframe :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s16-15m.png">

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s16-15m-2.png">

For finding how lower our price can go we can use fibonacci range with the mentioned above settings which are `0,0.5,1,1.5,2 etc`.

But how to know which level to target is that we need to checkout which level is getting aligned nearby with our liquidity area or sell stops, as ou can see above in the image that our 1 level is getting aligned near to liquidity & how beautifull price has reached that level.

`Note :- We use the fibonacci levels on bodies & not on the high's & lows and thats why other people fail while using fibonacci levels on highest & lowest body in your trading range or area.`

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s16-15m-3.png">


You can notice above setup gives us multiple confirmations as mentioned below as our checklist items.

**Checklist :-**

- Does it given break of structure ? `Yes`
- Does it have imbalance? `Yes`
- Does it previous had opposite direction break of structure ? `Yes`
- Does it retraced into fair value gap at EST `9:30AM & IST 7:00PM` opening? `Yes`
- Does it run towards the liquidtiy & our order block from daily timeframe? `YES`
- Does our entry happens above the opening price according to our bearish POWER OF 3. `Yes`

**5m timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s16-5m.png">

As you can see setup is not clean as it was on `15m` timefrmae, but it doenst need to be, we take reference of higher timeframe for the clarity because there is lot of noise on lower timeframes.

If we find fair value gap on `15m timefrmae` we need to keep higher timeframe levels & fvg's into consideration while switching down to lower timefrmae just to see its price on it.

**1m timeframe :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s16-1m.png">

As you can see we have marked our liquidity area as well as `15m fvg` on the chart but in this section we will be focusing on the point where we are looking for another opportunities by keeping same higher timeframe analysis in the mind but mutiple other setups if we have missed the optimal one.

**Multiple setups :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s16-1m-2.png">

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s16-1m-3.png">

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s16-1m-4.png">

As you can see its easy to find setups `When you know what you are looking for according to bias` then even though if you miss entry it's gonna be there in terms of another opportunity.

Sometime market gives us multiple entries & sometimes its not but we dont need to get upset on it because we should be happy that our analysis is going right.

### FRIDAY PM SESSION LIQUIDITY POOL

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s16-liquidity-pool.png">

Every friday when price has delivered its desired move to discounted zone price retraces to premium zone which means on fridays if we are expecting bearish move it expands till the liquidity range & it retraces before its closing.

`After delivering price sucessfully till what level does it retrace?`

It retraces to `AM` session stronges high which pushed the price downside to the desired liqudidity level drastically, we draw the area around that and thats where price likely to retrace as you can see in the image above.

In terms of smart money view you can notice smart money exits their short position wich they was holding at the very lowest point of the friday by engineering sell side liquidity for opposite direction before retracing into `PM Session liquidity pool` & they enter into buy side position targetting that `PM session liquidity pool` so they can take benifit of that move.

**Entry for fridays retracement move :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s16-liquidity-pool-entry.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s16-liquidity-pool-entry-2.png">

As you can see we have setup formed for `MSS + FVG` for the entry & also mitigation block reside over there so with double confirmaiton for buy side we can take entry for targetting that liquidity pool which we discussed earlier.

### 2022 Model for FOREX

In this section we will be looking for 2022 model for applying in the forex market and we are currently having look on EURUSD for looking for `MSS + FVG` setup.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s17-1d-2.png">

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s17-1d.png">

As you can see price have took out buy side liquidity on daily timeframe & now it will be moving to downside for the liquidity resting below the equal lows.

As you can see the current day candle have took out previous day liquidity but it stilll having unfinished business to take out the liqudity resting below the next equal low'a liqudity.

**1h analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s17-1h.png">

How we get to know till what level price can go down for targetting, for that we use fibonacci levels with the preivously saw settings for figuring out levels for `0,0.5,1,1.5,2,2.5,3 etc`.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s17-1h-2.png">

As you can see on the current day of trading we will be keeping eye on opening price the fvg formed where price can lead for manipulation stage of bearish day.

**15m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s17-15m.png">

As you can see we have marked opening price from `EST 12:00AM & IST 9:30AM` above which there is `1h fvg` where price is retracing but on that same level price traded multiple times. Its not buying & selling pressure but price is delivering multiple opportunities above the opening price.

But not only retracement in `1h fvg` matters but at what time of day its retracing also matters so you can notice we have marked a `15m timeframe fvg` in which price is retraced in `NEW YORK OPEN KILL ZONE EST 7:00AM TO 10:00AM & IST 4:30PM TO 7:30PM` and thats our point of intrest should be before the entry, our setup should full fill the critiria of time as well along with technicals.

Let's switch down to lower timeframes.

`Note :- Do not use EST 8:30AM TO 11:00AM & IST 6:00PM TO 9:30PM for forex, its the morning session time for futures but for forex use the NEW YORK OPEN KILL ZONE EST 7:00AM TO 10:00AM & IST 4:30PM TO 7:30PM & other kill zones accoriding to pair & setup.`


**5m timeframe :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s17-5m.png">

As you can see we have marked the fvg which formed in the new york open kill zone which is `EST 7:00AM TO 10:00AM & IST 4:30PM TO 7:30M` in previous section and we will focuing in that section.

In the current chart you can see we have marked the new york open kill zone timings & also order block level referring to body of order block candle & there is a news as well coming down at `EST 10:00AM`.

We dont care about the news but you can see price in the previous swing took out sell side liquidity from previous swing low & again traded to same level which was the false move before the news release to take out the sellers who was trailing their stoploss to recent swing low's and `thats why we need to keep the stoploss above the swing high rather than fair value gap`

Let's zoom into shaded area where we will be learning how the `MSS + FVG` setup is applicable here by switching to lower timeframe.

**4m timeframe :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s17-4m.png">

You can see we have marked `EST 8:30AM & IST 6:00PM` opening price on the chart & there is an Fair value gap formed after market structure shift that's where we will be taking entry into our trade by keeping stoploss above its swing high & we will be targetting the fib level near to `1.90000` big figure as we have discussed in the previous sections.

`Note :- As you know we have discussed earlier that we need to refer to the opening price of the new york with EST 12:00AM & IST 9:30AM but we need to keep in mind the opening price as EST 8:30AM & IST 6:00PM and we need to refer the lower one because we want to use the minimum threshold for our entry.`

### How ICT would have traded with funded accounts with 2022 model

In this session how ict would have to start from his initial day's how he would have approached to trading to be an profitable trader with this 2022 model.

**ICT SETUP :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/ict-setup.png">

ICT have 3 timeframes setup with trading view which are daily, 1h & 15m timeframes.

So whatever we mark on daily timeframe it is visible to other timeframes as well so due to which we can be in the flow of daily bias & analysis.

`Note :- Can we look for the entry and analysis on phone? No, we should not look for analysis as there is very less amount of data you are looking at so you can manage your trades on phone but you should not do your analysis on your phone.`

**1st Step daily bias :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s18-1d.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s18-1d-2.png">

As you can see this is the same chart for the next day which about which we have identified the bias for price took out buy side liqudity & now targetting the sell side liqudity resting below equal lows and currently price is moving to target the liquidity resting below the swing low.

This is all about our daily bias. But do we need to target that liqudity & can it be moved in single day? It can but it can take serval days to reach over there as well.

So in the intraday timeframe we would be targetting previous day low in terms of bearish bias & high in terms of bullish days & we have marked previous day high & low on the chart by considering we are trading in next day of it.

**2nd Step 1h analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s18-1h.png">

On the hourly chart we are able to see that daily timeframe fair value gap is also exists on hourly chart which is connfimation of its being high probability.

On the hourly chart we fine tuned our levels, marked the annotations such as liquidty & we look out if the hourly chart is in the same direction of daily chart in terms of price action and bias we mark any important levels or fair value gaps on hourly if exists any.

**3rd step 15m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s18-15m.png">

After switching to 15m timefrme we first mark the new york midnight `EST 12:00AM & IST 9:30AM` opening price & we draw a horizontal line till `EST 10:00AM & IST 7:30PM` as its ending time of new york kill zone which is `EST 7:00AM TO 10:00AM & IST 4:30PM TO 7:30PM`.

Now we wait untill the relative equal high's to be taken out & we look for `Market Structure Shift (MSS)` & `Fair Value Gap formed due to it` in our new york kill zone.

In this timefrmae as we are having bearish bias from daily timefrmae we would be expecting market to moving higher first above to new york midnight open price before going lower according to `POWER OF THREE (PO3)`.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s18-15m-2.png">

When the fair value gap forms in new york open kill zone above the opening price in our bearish bias after market structure shift we would be taking entry on the lowest point of the fair value gap.

We can keep our stoploss above the swing high if range is small & we can keep stoploss above the displacement candle high if range is bigger.

We will be targetting for the liqudity resting below the previous day low which we have marked on the daily timeframe.

**Fine Tuning the setup :-**

For fine tuning the entries & for more confirmations we switch to lower timeframe such as `5,4,3,2,1`.

**5m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s18-5m.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s18-5m-2.png">

When we switch to 5m timeframe we look out the 15m fair value area, for searching does it have fair value gap on 5m timeframe & if it have multiple one's we target the lowest one because it would be easiest possible entry.

As you can see in the image above there are multiple fair value gaps around that level but we have marked the lowest one out of them.

Additional confirmation in the setup is that there is orderblock which is opposite direction sudden move before actual move according to which there are 3 consecutive candles there before price started moving downside and thats the orderlblock

`Note :- If your orderblock does not include imbalance or fair value gap in it its not an valid orderblock, orderblock is only valid if it does contain imbalance on lower timeframe.`

When price has entered into that orderblock & also our fine tuned fair value gap on 5m timeframe thats how your high probability trade looks like & we will be taking entry into it by keeping stoploss above the swing high & targetting previous day low liquidity.

`Note :- You need to make sure that your limit order should be placed into our new york kill zone, even though if price does not retrace into it in kill zone but your limit order should be placed inside the kill zone if not you need to look for better opportunitity because purpose of kill zone is the same that you can place the order & you can walk away rather than sitting in front of chart.`  


### Session 19 ICT LIVE COMMENTARY

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s19-1d.png">

On the daily timeframe we we will be looking for bullish prices & as you can see we have hit our 2 targets which was `100,101` as marked on the chart.

**USDX 1h analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s19-1h.png">

As you can see how beautifully price given market structure & retraced into fair value gap but see it does not closed the price above that, it very well respected that fair value gap even on hourly timeframe.

We as ICT trader need to get aligned the move with algorithmic price delivery in which algorithm will deliver the price either ways.

And also if we focus on the recent price swing & if we mark the fib on that price is deliverying from premium to discounted zone.

So according to forex fundamentals if dollar is bullish we will be going to be bearish on `EURUSD, GBPUSD` like pairs.

**USDX 15m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s19-15m.png">

As you can see we are able to see hourly orderblock on 15m timeframe but you can notice if we look from the 15m timeframe prespective we have orderblock resting there/

So when price is retracing in hourly fair value gap its also retracing into orderblock which is another level of confirmation for the entry, you can consider orderblock as bookmark lets say while reading you need to go somewhere so when you come back price is gonna refer to that bookmark which means it going to go back into that order block.

The setup occured in the opposite direction of the daily order flow and we are not advised to take such trade who is not promoting the higher timeframe bias & order flow.

**EURUSD 1D :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s19-eurusd-1d.png">

As you can see on the daily timeframe EURUSD has took out sell side liquidity and there is possibility that now price can go in the premium zone for retracing into the fair value gap which was created when recent price swing got broken while moving to downside.

So as it took out the liquidity already now it can move upside to retrace into that fair value gap to rebalance the price as well to deliver the price form discount zone to premium zone.

**EURUSD 1H :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s19-eurusd-1h.png">

You can see on the hourly chart price came down do the level we have marked on the daily low & price given MSS to the upside & also created FVG in which we can take the entry by targetting premium zone above `0.5%`.

This trade which we are discussing is opposite to the direction of higher timeframe but you need to backtest your model & you need expertise to figure out till what level price can go even in the opposite direction and how you can trade for it.

But for beginners its not advised to trade against the bias of daily timeframe.

**EURUSD 15M :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/S19-eurusd-15m.png">

We are reffering to the same trade which we just saw in previous section for 1h timeframe, there was other setups as well around it but why we have choosed that setup is the strong displacement.

You can checkout how strongly price displaced after market structure shift and beginner might think that it can go down to target the liquidity resting below the equal lows to downside below the low.

BUT

Being an ICT trader we have narrative that price already took out sell side liquiditiy even from the daily timeframe so it will be seeking for buy side liquidity now and thats why we get confirmation for our bullish entry as we are showing on the chart.

`Note :- We need a higher timeframe bias & narrative where the price is hading exactly and why and then only we should coulple MSS + FVG entry with it, without the narrative & the bias if taken trades on setup thats the reason most people fails.`

**GBPUSD 1D :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s19-gbpusd-1d.png">

We are having look on `GBPUSD` daily timeframe for identifying the bias and as you can see `FVG` is formed after `MSS` & we was expecting for price to take the sell stops resting below the previous swing low & price delivered to that level very well.

Untill & unless price is below that `DAILY FVG` we will be keeping our bias bearish on GBPUSD.

**GBPUSD 1H :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s19-gbpusd-1h.png">

We are referring to hourly timeframe for GBPUSD but we are not able to see anything claer on the chart, this is what called as sloppy price action where price is trading both of the ways & taking liquidity on both sides.

We need to get comfortable with such environments where no opportunity will be present in the market & we need to accept & be comfortable with rather than forcing the trades & lossing money in it.

**GBPUSD 15M :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s19-gbpusd-15m.png">

As as hourly timeframe there is no clear direction on 15m timeframe for GBPUSD and in such scenarios just shut down your computer and do the things you love to do outside of the market.

We dont need to trade daily, if you are getting excited to trade daily then its not trading its gambling & we are not promoting gambling here. real trading is about trading single lot & doubling your account with minimum possible risk & consitent profits.

**EMINI S&P 1D :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s19-sp-1d.png">

We are having look on daily timeframe for S&P and price took out buy stops & now retraced into the discounted zone or equilibrium from premium so there is a possiblity price can move to upside now.

If we are expecting bullish move it can go up to median point of bearish order block candle which we have drawn on daily timeframe but the easiest of it is the low of that candle which is easily achieveable.

The only thing we need to do is to buy below openig price & we can target for the low of the bearish orderblock candle & we can take entry with purge and reverse.

`Purge & reverse :- Price takes out previous swing low in bullish env & swing high in bearish env and it goes to the high of previous 3 days.`

**EMINI S&P 1H :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s19-sp-1h.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s19-sp-1h-2.png">

We have dropped down to 1h timeframe for by keepin bullish bias in mind for reaching out to the low of daily orderblock candle.

We cannot see any reference in hourly chart for the move which is already happend but we are going to drop down to lower timeframe to figure out the entry & we will be targetting the liquidity resting above the relative equal highs as mentioned in the second image above.

**EMINI S&P 15M :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/S19-SP-15M.png">

We have dropped down to 15m timeframe for finding our setups which we wasnt able to figure out any refrerence point on hourly chart.

We have marked `EST 12:00AM & EST 8:30AM` which is `IST 9:30AM & 6:00PM` and sometimes price dont goes down below the new york midnight in bullish env & above in bearish vice versa thats why we consider 8:30am as well as opening price so we can refer to it for the entries below the opening price when its not ran down to newyork midnight open.

`Note :- When midnight price is below than est 8:30am price then prefer to 8:30am pricing & if 8:30am price is below than midnight open then we are having price at really really discounted price.`

Lets focus on price in the new york session after `EST 8:30AM & IST 9:30AM` on lower timeframes.

**EMINI S&P 5M :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/S19-SP-5M.png">

Here you can see after the new york open we expect to short term lows taken out for smart money to enter & then draw the price towards the liquidity we are targetting from the 15m chart.

Notice after taking short term lows how price has retraced into `FVG` which is cherry on the cake, we was having bullish bias, price is trading below newyork midnight & EST 8:30AM open and also it retraced into an fair value gap so thats where all confluences are getting lined up.

We can take entry by targetting the liquidtity from 15m timeframe range & by keeping stoplossbelow the `FVG` swing low.

**EMINI S&P 1M :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s19-sp-1m.png">

As you can see according to our 2022 model we got entry on 1m timeframe where price given `MSS + FVG` where price smoothly retraced & price got delivered to the liquidity resting above the buy stops from the 15m timeframe.

### 2022 MODEL FOR LONDON OPEN KILL ZONE

In this section we will be having look on how to use 2022 model `MSS + FVG` setup in london session as mentioned below.

**1h analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s20-1h.png">

In the aboe chart you can notice according to our previous section analysis we was expecting price to be draw below 100 level, But how much low?

Till the `99.20` level because it aligns with the fair value which is the low of the day to its left side which has been formed after `MSS + FVG` in previous trading days & we was expecting price to target the liquidity resting above the previous swing high.

As we mentioned earlier we will be learining `MSS + FVG` setup for london session.

**15m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s20-15m.png">

We have fine tuned our 1h analysis to 15m timeframe as we can notice when price reached to our expected level `99.20` price created low of the day in the london open kill zone & it given MSS & FVG formed after breakout of intermediate swing high and price retraced into it.

We can take entry in it cleanly & we can target liquidity or buy stops resting above previous swing highs which are also relative equal high's.

**Lets relate usdx analysis with trading pairs :-**

**EURUSD 1H :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s20-eur-1h.png">

At the same time you can notice eur had reached to weekly high & pierced it for buy side liquidity which is very obvious after which price will be likely to go lower for rebalancing price or taking, coming down to discount zone from preum zone & to target sell side liquidty.

So we are having bias for bearish for EURUSD according to the analysis we did on USDX in previous sections.

**EURUSD 2M :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s20-eur-2m.png">

At the very moment where price took out buy side liquidity we will be hunting for `MSS + FVG` setup in it by having look on smaller timeframe such as `15m, 5, 3m, 1m` etc.

While dropping to smaller timeframe we found very clean setup for `MSS + FVG` setup in it.

BUT

when price has created fvg you can notice its next candle is bearish which we cant consider for the entry because we want strong displacement from fair value gap before retracing in it so we will be waiting for tha displacement from that fair value gap & retracing into it.

After some time price retraced into our fvg where we can take entry by keeping stoploss above the swing high above weekly range.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s20-eur-target.png">

We can target the area around discounted zone with imbalance or sell side liquidity which will be around 50% & we can keep some order for remaining run till the fair value gap mentioned in the above image because thats where price can go for rebalancing.

### USD Index Corelation with Futures

In this section we will be having look on USDX & Futures Co-relation and how we can utilitze it for confirmation, confluences or important factor of our entries

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s21-1h.png">

You can see below orange line chart is representing the price of `EMINI S&P JUNE 2022` contract & the point where we have reached to the low below `99.20` level as we have discussed in the previous section emini made high of it.

When the Usd dollar started its move to upside `EMINI S&P JUNE 2022` started to going lower, `when dollar rised emini goes lower` and this is the co-relation for the usdx.

Lets dig into emini for the setup according to the discussed context.

**EMINI :-**

**1d analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s21-emini-1d.png">

On the daily timeframe orderblock formed in which price has retraced and we are expecting price to take out sell side liquidity either by giving strong rejection in the fair value gap formed or its going stright down to raid the liquidity.

**1h analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s21-emini-1h.png">

On the 1h timeframe we can see we when price was was retracing a little bit upside and on the day it took out previous day high in bearish bias we was expecting price to flirt with `4320` level but it didn't & its okay. even ICT gets wrong sometimes.

**15m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s21-emini-15m.png">

You can notice even our bias was bullish & according to PO3 (Power of three) we should look for the opportunities above the opening price.

If we are trading in the london session we should refer to `EST 12:00AM & IST 9:30AM` as opening price & if we are trading in new york session we should refer to `EST 8:30AM & IST 6:00PM`.

But 

Price didnt given the juda swing which is the false move against the direction of the day so what to do? Sometimes market are so much unidirectional that it doesnt gives an false move but we should not think in the way that they know this stuff, price delivery algoritm is changing and all those things.

It is the part of game, somemtimes we dont get opportunity according to setup but its totally okay than forcing your setup & getting into wrong entry which can lead you to losses.

But we have got onee entry even if it doesnt respect po3 condition, In the new york session price took out recent swing low and given `MSS + FVG` setup which we can trade & if we are trading in new york if we refer to the EST `8:30AM & IST 6:00PM` as opening price then also we got an setup wehre price took out short term low and given `MSS + FVG` setup where we can take the entry.

**5m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s21-emini-5m.png">

According to our setup in the new york session we look for the left side equal lows in terms or bearish MSS & equal highs for bullish MSS.

We will be refering to new york opening time as  `EST 8:30AM & IST 6:00PM` after which price took out relative equal lows & given bearish `MSS + FVG` setup where we can take the entry.

We can keep our stoploss above previous 2 swing high's & we can target for the liquidity area which we have marked on daily timeframe.

Let's dig down to lower timeframes for more details.

**3m, 2m, 1m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s21-emini-3m.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s21-emini-2m.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s21-emini-1m.png">

We are able to see our 5m entry along with some other entries within the smaller timeframes, where we can get into the already going on move with this kind of moves.

Sometimes our setup does not establish as it should but it all that matters is the daily bias if we are holding on it then we can look for such kind of small timeframe steup carefully.

### Rewinding what we have covered up till now

In this section we will be coming back to what we was looking & learning from last several weeks on emini S&P FUTURES.

**1d :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s22-1d.png">

You might remember from last session that we was expecting price to be moving downwards after retracing into daily bearish order block to take out the sell side liquidity resting below the previous swing low's.

**1h :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s22-1h.png">

As you can with the bearish bias in mind from the daily timeframe, we are are able to see gap in the price as well as an fair value gap, but we are not able to see any market structure shift or other details at the moment.

Look how perfectly the candles are respecting the fair value gap, volume is there, price is going above that fair value gap but not the bodies which is an strong indication of high probability fair value gap.

SO WHAT DO WE DO?

We switch to lower timeframe to lookout for more details.

**15m :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s22-15m.png">

As you can notice on the 15m timeframe we have marked `EST 8:30AM & IST 6:00PM` time with horizontal line.

We mark the `EST 8:30AM & IST 6:00PM` opening price to which we are going to refer as we are trading in new york session.

After new york opening what price did? price took out buy stops resting above the short term swing high & it given `MSS + FVG` setup by keeping our bearish daily bias in mind & we will be expecting price to reachout the liqudity marked with the below line from the daily timeframe.

**5m :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s22-5m.png">

As we have dropped down to lower timeframe we are able to see more relative equal high's left to the new york est 8:30am opening and we will be expecting price to take out that buy side liquidity whicih price did before bearish `MSS + FVG`.

lets zoom in to the area where price took out buy side liquidity on 5m timefrmae on 1m timeframe.

**1m timeframe :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s22-1m.png">

You can notice we have zoomed into the area where price took out buys side liquidity, and we are able to notice there is very short term swing low over there where we have pointed out.

When price given bearish `MSS + FVG` setup to it, we can take fine tuned entry there by keeping higher timeframe bias in mind & we can target for the nearish opposing liquidity or the liquidity from the daily timeframe marked with the blue line on the chart.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s22-1m-stop.png">

We can keep our stoploss above our `FVG` but by considering the volatility in the market we should give breathable space to our trade rahter than ony focusing on profits like gamblers & we are not learning gambling here. 

We can keep she stoploss with the marked level in the image for price to give flexibility & we can enter into the trade.

**ICT trade in NASDAQ with this narrative :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s22-nq-5m.png">

What we are able to see here, price took out previous swing high or buy side liqudity, created long term high & bearish `MARKET STRUCTURE SHIFT` and it created 2 fair value gaps.

In those 2 fair value gaps above one is likely to reach out & sweep through lower fair value gap and we can take high probability entry on higher or lower fair value gap.

But ICT missed that move & ict took entry when price traded into blue shared area.

WHY???

Because there is micro `MSS + FVG` setup after our main setup which is double confirmation of price to be drawing lower according to our daily bias on emini & emini, nasdaq moves into same direction.

After that second confirmaotion in that blue zone, what is there have you noticed? bearish orderblock, but in 2022 model we didnt learned about orderblocks.

Lets breakdown that orderblock in lower timeframe.

**1m timeframe :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s22-nq-1m.png">

As you can see we have fine tuned outr order block to the bullish candle before the short market structure shift & when price retraced into that orderblock ict entered with `3 CONTRACTS` in.

When price again broke down 3 swing lows after drawing above the order block and created `MSS + FVG` setup ict entered `2 CONTRACTS` & when price again given the same setup on micro structure ict entered with `1 CONTRACT`.

You can notice how ict deployed his big position with fractions, biggest position at initially & reducing the size gradually & ict targetted the liquidity from the 5m timeframe drawn.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s22-emini-smt.png">

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s22-nq-smt.png">

As you can see according to our bearish bias emini was strongly bearish whereas nasdaq given smt divergence.

Means

Emini creating lower low where nasdaw created its higher high which indicates it was stop raid before the downmove & that's the co-relation we should look for rather than others. 

When all things combined & directing towards single direction that's where high probability setup forms.


### ICT LIVE TRADE

In this session we will how ict took trade & what was the analysis behind it.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s23-1m.png">

In the above section we are having bullish bias from higher timeframe & there is fomc also aligning in our trade.

According to bullish bias from daily timeframe we are expecting price to draw lower to the blue line which is the order block line from higher timeframe & there is also an imbalance aligning nearby to that orderblock level.

Only we are expcting our price to retrace in order block, retracing into higher timeframe order block because that will the only level price can go lower before breaking pervious day high marked with red line.

When price will be retracing into HTF orderblock + imbalance + draw on sell side liquidity for previous swing low & then we are expecting price to go higher for breaking out previous day high.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s23-1m-target.png">

As you can see price retraced into our marked out imbalance & rallyed to the green level above previous day high.

BUT WHY TP LEVEL THERE?

Because the only thing we know that price will be going higher than previous day high till where we can figure out that with the help of fibs, we have marked the fib on price leg before bullish move from highest to lowest body we got that level

Thats why we have choosed that level for take profit.

### Decision Making for 2022 Model

In this section we will be learning how to handle the scenarios which doen't paint out as we expect.

**1d analysis :-**
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s24-1d.png">

After the FOMC day we was expecting the to be relative equal high's to be taken out & then move lower according to our bias.

**1h analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s24-1h.png">

In the above image you can see we was expecting price to take out buy side liquidity resting above the blue line drawn for relative equal high's.

BUT IT DIDN'T TOOK OUT BS LIQUIDITY & NOT MOVED ACCORDING TO OUR EXPECTATION.

WHY????

LET'S TAKE LOOK AT IT ON LOWER TIMEFRAME.

**15m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s24-5m.png">

According to whatever we have learned till the date we was expecting juda swing after `EST 9:30AM & IST 7:00PM` open in which we was expecting price to expect in that `FVG` drawn out in the above image.

After that according to our setup what we expect is that, according to bias directoin for bullish we expect strong displacement to buy side & to form  `BULLISH MSS + FVG` for the entry to the buy side.

But can you notice it didn't formed which would indicate us for the buy side entry & but people took entry for the buy side in the retracement of that fair value gap without waiting to our setup form for confirmation would have lost money most probably.

**5M analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s24-5m.png">

As you can see according to our rules the low created by price when retraced into fair value gap should have been taken out strongly with buy side displacement & relative equal high's to forming `MSS + FVG` setup & if it's not just stay out of our trade.

**Where our 2022 MODEL setup forms :-**

- **Our Robust Model :-**

  <img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s24-first-approach.png">

  As we have studied till the date about the model, we first loook for the relative equal high's in terms or bearish setup & relative equal low's for bullish setup.

  Then we wait to price take out that relative equal high's or low's liquidity & give market structure shift to the opposing side with strong displacement.

  `We mark the area for displacement high to low for looking out the fair value gaps in it after sucessfull strong displacment which shifted the market structure`

  When we find fair value gap in it & price retraces to it `after confirmation of market structure shift to opposing side + draw on liquidity + retracement in fair value gap` then only we take entry.

- **Our Model when price retraces into imbalance :-**

  <img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s24-imb-approach.png">

  Here in this approach all the logic is the same. treat that fair value gap low as an your realtive equal high's which are broken.

  For our setup to form what price needs to do?, it needs to take out the liquidity resting below the short term low which is created before retracing intto fair value gap.

  Until and unless it is taken out that too with the strong displacement there is no setup there and we need to stay out of it if it doesn't qualifies our critiria.

  ### Model with seasonal tendencies

  In this section we will be coupling our modal with seasonal tedencies.

**1d analysis :-**

  <img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s25-1d.png">
  <img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s25-1d-2.png">

  You can notice in the first image we are at price point where we have analyzed that price will likely to target te sell side liquidity after retracing into daily orderblock.

  why sell side liquidity? `Because In the May's USDX, NASDAQ, S&P likely to go lower` and it is not just fact but it is the repetative move has been captured over the period of time.

  Lets focus where price took out sell side liquidity resting below the relative equal low's.

  <img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s25-1d-3.png">

  Notice when price took out the liquidity there was no `FVG` formed nor anyone expected & able to find the fair value gap in it, but let's see ict perception on it.

  The candle formed after that day seems to be indecisive candle but NOOOOO!!!!

  ICT is having differet perception about it & trying to teach something out of it.

  Lets zoom into that area.

**1h analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s25-1h.png">

We have marked `EST 12:00AM & IST 9:30AM` opening prices on the chart with vertical line for segrigating price action for individual days.

You can see after breaking it down to 1h timefrmae what we are able to notice?

The day we saw on daily timeframe as indecisive candle we are able to see price after `EST 9:30AM & IST 7:00PM` price took out relative equal high's & drawn to sell side liquidity and closed near the day opening.

The day seemed to us as indecisive candle but inside it price delivered form premium to discount zone & retraced around its opening price.

**15m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s25-15m.png">

On the 15m timefrmae we have marked our new york opening which is `EST 8:30AM & IST 6:00` & what pric did is PO3 formation for bearish setup.

You can notice price balanced to the fridays low of previous week at very `EST 9:30AM & IST 7:00PM` & then given strong displacement to downside, we are not able to see clear fair value gap in it but it delivered to the sell side liquidity after that breakdown.

Let's zoom into it lower timeframe for checking out the fair value gaps have been created within that displacement after rebalancing price to friday's low.

**5m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s25-5m.png">

As you can see are now focusing on the area where price created its high of the day after `EST 9:30AM & IST 6:00PM`.

We are still not able to see the fair value gap in it when it given displacement to the downside & given market structure shift. 

`SO WHAT DO WE DO? WE SWITCH DOWN TO LOWER TIMEFRAME IN SEARCH OF IT`

Let's switch down to smaller timeframe for it.

**4m & 3m timeframe :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s25-4m.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s25-3m.png">

We are able to see one fair value gap in the price but you can see price is not into the premium zone where we should likely to sell.

`NOTE :- If fair value gap forms & price retraces into it in premium zone in bearish & discounted zone in bullish environment don't take that trade. We dont want to sell in discounted zone & buy into premium zone as we are already entering at expensive price soo.`

**2m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s25-2m.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s25-2m-sl.png">

As you can notice we have found our fair value gap on 2m timefrmae so we dont need to dig down to lower timeframe anymore.

When price retraces into the fair value gap we will be taking entry for sell side by keeping our `stoploss atleast above the candle's high which created the fair value gap. or best case scenario would be above the swing high` & we can target for the sell side liquidity.

`Note :- Price delivery algorithm resets on EST 12:00AM & IST 9:30AM not on welington open in the AU sessoin.`

`Note :- There is no need to join the private mentorhip or ICT BECAUSE!!!! in that mentorship lot's of things got teached & everything works and ict let their students build their model around those concepts, but its better to focus on 1 pair, 1 setup will take us to profitability so we don't need to overwhelm ourselves with lot of concepts such as breaker, mitigation blocks, efficiencies, etc`

### Trading Against daily bias with institutional orderflow

In this section we will be having look how ict trades in liver market, how trails stoploss, how set target everything.

We are having look on EMINI-S&P on 1m timeframe and we will be trading against the dailu bias which is bearish but ICT is taking trade for buy due to institutional flow.

**Entry :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s26-entry.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s26-fvg.png">

As you can ICT took entry into buyside position with 4 lots.

WHY???

Because price took sell side liquidity & also retraced into an `FVG` which occured after `MSS` and we are expecting price to take out buyside liquidity.

**PYRAMID ENTRY :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s26-pyramid.png">

As you can see in price has given the strong displacement to the upside & took out buy side liquidity when our trade is going on.

After that price has retraced into order-block which we are considering relative equal high consecutive candles.

We entered added `2 contracts` into our positoin as as we it given us another opportunity in our existing setup.

`NOTE :- Even if you are already in trade & if it given setup on macro level then we add the position in the existing trade & we trail the stoploss a little bit to manage the risk.`

**Target :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s26-target.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s26-target-2.png">

As you can see we have marked the buyside liquidity for the target but it's not necessary price needs to be reached over there for profitibility we can sell larget portion of our position when price will take our the relative equal which will be our first target.

**Stop Loss :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s26-sl.png">

As you can see according to our traditional entry model we kept our stoploss below the displacement & `FVG low`.

**Trailing Stoploss :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s26-tsl.png">

As you can see as soon as we have added position into our trade we have trailed our stoploss below the order block low as our second setup based on it.

We have trailed our stoploss according to our 2nd pyramid entry model which was orderblock so we have trailed our stoploss below the low of the order block.


**Exit :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s26-exit.png">

As you can see price moved towards our objective to take out large amount of position which was short term buy side liquidity.

Price didnt reache our target within the single candle, it slowly & steadily delivered according to our price delivery algorithm.

`We left the 2 lots for letting it run towards the liquidity we have marked above our short term liquidity, and we monitor the trade if it breaks the market structure to downside we are exiting the trade.`

`Note :- Once we are in setup, we should trust that setup & it can move against us as well but we just need to follow setup by not keeping expection of price will hit our target in direct movement.`


### Counter trade Ideas

In this section we will be having look on counter trade ideas.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s27-1d.png">

You can see in the last week, price dropped strongly in last 4 days from monday & on friday it is trading higher side.

The point where we are pointing on the chart clean having relative equal high's which we are expecting to be taken.

**1h analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s27-1h.png">

As you can see price already took sell side liquidity to previously relative equal low's & in the current moment already trading higher to those.

If we have imbalance in the way we expect to price reach out to that before liquidity but we are already upside of the imbalance & now we are expecting price to take out buy side liquidity above that relative equal high's.

**15m & 5m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s27-15m.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s27-5m.png">

`As we know that if we are expecting price to be likely going to higher first it grabs the nearest liquidity of counter side to shift higher AS WE HAVE LEARNT IN MARKET MAKER MODEL`

After liquidity taken & juda swing which traded price below opening price it drastically delivered to the higher side.

In lunch hours as we know it likely to give retracement in that retracement in traded into the discounted zone, as well as it had retraced into the fair value gap which we have marked in the 5m chart above.

We will be focuing on the fair value gap formed after displacement out of the retracement consolidation in lower timeframes.

**4m,3m,2m timeframe :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s27-3m.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s27-4m.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s27-2m.png">

While we was switching to lower timeframe we found the `MSS + FVG` setup on 2m timeframe where we can take the entry based on the confirmations such as `OB + FVG + DISCOUNT ZONE + HTF (Higher timeframe) FVG`.

we can keep the stoploss below the `HTF FVG` and we can target for buy stops resting above relative equal highs which we have marked with blue line.

`Note :- When you are annotating your chart put the information as you are talking to you in simple words which builds the habits & confidence about our analysis & how its paiying off on the chart.`

### ICT LIVE TRADE

In this section ict will be taking live trade according to 2022 model, we will be looking out each & every move took by ICT & the reason behind it.

This is the day before retail rate, fedral chairman is spekaing tomorrow which are high volatility news event, The day going to be quite & lathargic but it take lot of experience to trade in such day.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s29-1d.png">

As you can see on daily timeframe `EMINI S&P` is trading around `4000` on the current day and we are expecting price likely to be moving higher to take out buy side liquidity resting above relative equal high's.

**1m timeframe :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s29-1m-smt.png">

As you can see `NASDAQ` was creating lower low's which is relative pair to `EMINI S&P` but emini refused to create lower low's 2 times & it given SMT divergence 2 times over `NASDAQ` and we was having bullish bias accoriding to daily timeframe.

**Entry :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s29-1m.png">

As you can see we was having daily bias as bullish, pric given smt divergence on emini referecing to nasdaq & given bullish `MSS + FVG` entry on it.

Price retraced in `FVG` multiple times and ict took entry over there, again when price given `MSS + FVG` to the short term high ICT added the position into the trade.

**Stop Loss :-**

Ict have kept the stoploss gelow the displacement low & FVG low & he have trailed the stoploss when it given another `MSS + FVG` in macros.

**Target :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s29-1m.png">

We will be targetting the buy side liqiudity resting above the relative equal high's & we will be exitting our full position over there.

### 2022 SETUP IN NEWS ENVIORNMENT

In this session we will be having look how ICT took entry even in the news enviornment along with our 2022 model & the narrative behind it.

**1m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s30-1m.png">

There was an news event at `EST 2:00PM` after lunch hours & price first expanded above, cleared the liquidity resting above the new york lunch hours relative equal highs & drastically moved downside why to an `imbalance or FVG`.

When it retraced into it was an entry point ict was looking for but it expanded and ict missed the entry, but price created bullish order block & retraced into it thats where ict took the entry into the trade.

By keeping stoploss below the low created by price below `FVG` & ICT targetted liquidity above the marked area by red line around `12553.25`.

As you can see price given 2 false moves first by taking out buy side after lunch hours liquidity & then taking out the sell side liquidity and then after retracing into imbalance its started its orignal move.

**1h analysis -**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s30-1h.png">

As you can see we was expecting price to take out the liquidity marked above the area on the hourly timeframe according to our daily bias.

**1d analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s30-1d.png">

As you can see after taking sell side liquidity on daily timeframe it formed an relative equal high's & we was expecting price to take nearest buy side liquidity according to which we looked for buy side setup on lower timeframes & we wait patiently for it.

### What if we dont get setup in our kill zones or New york opeings

In this section we will be having look on `EMINI S&P` for finding the entry out of our New york opening timings & how to find the setup if we didn't find any in our setup timeframe.

**Higher timeframe analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s31-1d.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s31-1h.png">

As you can see we was expecting price to take the liquidity resting below the low of previous day from daily timefrrame.

On the hourly timeframe there was relative equal stacked in the zone where price can go to take the sell side liquidity resting over there.

**15m & 5m analysis :-**
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s31-15m.png">

As you can see on the 15m timeframe bearish order block formed in the downside move & according to our daily & hourly analysis we are expecting price to take out sell side liuqidity resting below previous day & relative equal lows.

**5m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s31-5m.png">

As you can see price took out relative equal lows & with strong displacement to downside & given `MSS` & if formed `FVG` setup over there.

We will be taking entry into that fair value gap above which price sweeped but our stpoloss would be resting below the candle created `FVG` & we will be targetting the liquidity from daily & hourly timeframe.

**After lunch hours setups :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s31-2m.png">

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s31-2m-2.png">

As you can see it given multiple setups on micro level by keeping our daily & hourly timeframe bias in the mind.

It given the setup after taking out lunch hours liquidity & `MSS + FVG`, retracement into `FVG` given us the entry.

Same setup followed into the second image as well as mentioned above.

### Out side the previous day range (Choppy Day)

In this section we will be having look on choppy day which means in such days previous high & as well as low taken out no matter what daily order flow is.

We will deep dive into that day to understand how we can trade our `MSS + FVG` setup in it.

**1d analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s32-1d.png">

As you can see price took out previous day high first & then it took out previous day's low as well in daily expansion.

But it felt short to take the liquidity resting below the old low from daily timeframe.

Let's take look at lower timeframes.

**1h analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s32-1h.png">

As you can see relative equal high's have formed on hourly timeframe and we was expecting the liquidity resting above to be taken & it did it in its next swing.

**5m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s32-5m.png">

First of all we was having bearish bias previously to expect the price to be taken below the `3500.00` which we have marked on the chart for sell side liquidity.

But price didn't took the sell side liquidity & fell short of it & after that it retraced into an fair value gap & discounted zone which was an entry according to our setup & we would have took entry over there.

When price retraced into it we would have expect price to take out the liquidity resting below `3855` but it didn't, it just took out it's previous swing low & ride towards the upside.

After that price traded towards the `3933.25` level & it swept the liquidity, but not draw on liquidity and `DRAW - MOVE PENETRATING THE LEVEL WITH SOME PIPS` & `SWEEP - MOVE JUST PEARCING THE LEVEL BUT DOES NOT CLOSE ITS BODY BEYOND LEVEL`.

Then it came back into the discount zone & then it given the real & orignal move to take out the buysdie liquidity resting above `3933.25` & we was expecting price to come down to `50% or in discount zone` between `EST 3:00PM & 4:00PM & IST 12:00AM & 1:00AM`.

Lets switch down to lower timeframes for getting more clarity on it & its retracement into the time window as we mentioned.

**1m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s32-1m.png">

As we can see we was expecting price to trade down to discount zone & equilibrium in between `EST 3:00PM TO 4:00PM & IST 12:00AM TO 1:00AM`.

As price took out the liquidity resting above the `3933.25` it given strond displacement to lower side which caused `MSS + FVG` setup, price retraced into that and that's when we would be looking for enty for sell side.

We will be taking entry at the retracement by keeping stoploss above the candle caused `FVG` & by keeping the narrative of price to retracement in 50% and we will be targetting for the same.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s32-1m-2.png">

As you can see the live position of ict, ict took partial of his 2 positions out of 4 at the equilibrium & it kept 2 position running so either it hits the stops or target either is accpeted by ict.

`NOTE :- In the choppy days like this dont take trade until you are having clarity of the direction & untill and unless setups forms into the direction of your daily bias.`

### ICT'S SON TRADE EXAMPLE

In this section ict will be showing example of trade his own son took in his live account & what was the reasons & analysis behind from the ICT's teachings.

**1d analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s33-1d.png">

On the daily timeframe we was expecing sell side liquidity to be taken resting below the relative equal lows and opporunities in the same context.

**1h analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s33-1h.png">

On the hourly chart there was `Imbalance or FVG` where we was looking for retraement & more over price to be traded above that `FVG` because price normally takes the buy side liquidity before running to sell side.

But price didn't took the buy side liquidity, and as our setup advices we was waiting for relative equal lows to be taken out to `MSS + FVG` to be created & price took out the lows with strong displacement.

That's where we will be looking for our setup on lower timeframes for finding the entry.

**15m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s33-15m.png">

We will be focusing on the candle with strong displacement & caused the `MSS` on lower timeframe.

As you can after price delivering our target form daily timeframe for the liquidity resting below the equal low's it given the setup to buy side by bullish `MSS + FVG` and targetting for imbalance which we have marked on the chart above.

As it was friday it retraces a little bit to rebalnce the fridays range before closing for the week.

**5m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s33-5m.png">

As we have swithced to lower timeframe for finding `bearish  FVG` after the `MSS` to the sellside from the higher timeframe.

We will be taking entry on the retracement of price by keeping stoploss above the the candle which caused the `FVG or swing high` & we will be targetting for the the liquidity area marked with white line from the higher timeframe according to our bias.

**1m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s33-1m.png">

As you can see we was not able to see price going into the premium zone while retracing into the `FVG` but on the 1m timeframe we can see how the premium zone also getting aligned with our `FVG`.

### Sunday's Opening Gap 

In this section we will be seeing 2022 model in the gap down or gap up opening market scenario & how we can analyze or trade it.

**15m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s34-15m.png">

As you can see in the above image market had opened gap down & we have marked the area for the gap.

After the gap market moved lower, created relative equal lows & broke that relative equal high's but didn't gave any setup, created relative equal high's & broke those down with strong displacement but created very little `FVG`.

Given us the entry for the trade, dropped to take the sell side liquidity & retraced into higher timeframe `Imbalance or FVG`.

After retracing into imbalance it given bullish `MSS` with strong displacement & created `FVG` which gave us another entry for the trade & And targetted buy side liquidity resting above the gap opening price high.

Let's drop down to lower timeframe.

**5m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s34-5m.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s34-5m-2.png">

As you can see we have dropped down to 5m timeframe where we are able to see multiple setups.

When price opened & given firt bearish `MSS + FVG` entry for tartetting imbalance & sell side liquidity.

When price reversed from the `imbalance` after draw on sell side liquidity it given bullish `MSS + FVG + OB` setup potentially targetting towards buy side liquidity formed around the bearish `FVG` where our previous entry was there.

Price again came back down to sundays opening gap & given Bullish `MSS + FVG + OB` setup which was the best among these for targetting the buy sude liquidity which we have marked with purple line because it was not taken.

`Note :- Sunday's opening gap acts as dynamic support and resistance to the price thoruhgout the week, if price trading below that & weekly orderflow if bullish then it acts as support & if weekly order flow is bearish & price below that gap it acts resistance to price. SOMETIMES IT DOESNT CAM BACK TO THE GAP & IT RUNS AWAY FROM THAT GAP WHICH IS STRONG INDICATION OF PRICE BEHAVIOUR & ITS INTENTION TO GO HIGHER OR LOWER.`

**2m timeframe :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s34-2m.png">

As you can see we was not able to see clear `FVG` on the 15m & 5m charts but we are able to see the `MSS + FVG` setup more clearer on the 2m timeframe.

### How to use premium & discount zone to combine with our setup 

We can combine premium which is `price > 50%` & discount `price < 50%` ZONES with our `MSS + FVG` setup to make sure we are buying in discounts for long positions & we are selling in premium zone for shorts.

**How to use :-**

- First figure out what is the higher timeframe bias & where we are seeking the liquidity either on buy side or on sell side.

- Drop to lower timeframe for your entries such as `15m,5m,3m,1m` on whihc you are trying to find the setup in.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s34-prds.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s34-prds-2.png">

- Draw the fib from low to high for the price expansion swing which didn't came in discount yet & we are expecting it to retrace into the `discount (Long Positions)` & `Premium (Short Positions)`.

- If its already retraced into the zones we dont refer to the price legs for finding premium & discount because price has already delivered to discount or premium for that price swing.

### 


**1d analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s35-1d.png">

As you can see in the above image price is in downtrend & we was expecting price to retrace retrace into order block after it took out sell side liquidity.

It already retaraced into order block & still continuing to go higher which means it is willing to draw on buy side liquidity on short term relative equal high's.

**15m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s35-15m.png">

On the 15m timeframe you can notice after taking session opening premium high liquidity sweep price retraced into `FVG` & for draw on liquidity on it.

Then it consolidated little bit, created relative short term high's & after new york lunch hours it took out buy side liquidity resting above the realtive equal high's with strong displacement & retraced into the `OB`.

We will be dropping down to lower timeframes for the price action when price retraced into `OB` for more details.

**5m analysis :-**


<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s35-5m.png">

As you can see The point where we are noticing has given `MSS` with strong displacement to short term high & created `FVG` which gave us entry which we can & we wan target the liquidity marked with orange line from higher timeframe.

Let drop to lower timeframes for look into more details for `FVG RETRACEMENT AREA`.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s35-5m-2.png">

After our previous move price dropped into the `FVG` which is getting aligned with `OB` & thats where we will be taking entry, by keeping stoploss belwo the swing low or `FVG CANDLE LOW` and we will be targetting the orderblock mid or high from the daily timeframe.

**Divergence with NASDAQ :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s35-5m-smt.png">

As you can see we have plotted the lows of nasdaq into our charts & we can see an `SMT` divergence in `EMINI S&P 500`.

`NASDAQ` had made lower low but Emini refused to make lower low which means accumulation is going on in `EMINI S&P 500` & along with it we are also having daily bias of price to retracing into bearish orderblock from daily timeframe.

`Note :- Divergence happens at some important timings such as EST 8:30AM & IST 6:00PM, EST 9:30AM & IST 7:00PM, at news events etc. we need to keep eye on co-related pairs in such important timings.`

### Choosing right Entry

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s36-1h.png">

As you can see we have drawn the fib from swing high & swing low, Price is currently trading in discount zone & retraced into an `Imbalance or FVG` which indicates oversold conditions without any indicators.

**5m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s36-5m.png">

According to our hourly bias price is retraced into `FVG` AND WE ARE EXPECTING PRICE TO TO TAKE BUY SIDE LIQUIDITY.

As you can see when price first drawn on sell side liquidity & given bullish `MSS` with strong displacement which created `FVG` which gives us opportunity to go long by keeping stoploss below recent swing low or below the candle which created `FVG` and to target `Buyside Imbalance` marked or buy side liquidity.

**1m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s36-1m.png">

Here in the 1m chart you can see the trades took by ICT himself.

The reason behind the first trade was we was having our bullish bias in our mind & we was expecting price to take out buy side liqudity marked from 5m chart with read line, This entry was the first price leg before giving `MSS + FVG` setup on which we drawn `FVG`.

Price took the buy side liquidity at `EST 9:30AM & IST 7:00PM` & we took entry when price retraced into discount because we was confident enough that price will not take sell side liquidity because it didn't even at `EST 8:30AM & IST 7:00PM` news so we took the entry.


The second trade we are able to see on the screen is the setup which we just saw on 5m timeframe where price given bullish `MSS + FVG` setup & its the same on 1m timefrmae, where price created `FVG` on 1m timefrmae & retraced into it multiple times but ICT patiently waited to sell side liquidity taken & then took entry because price rallies towards its orignal move only when draws on opposing side liquidity.

ICT took entry by keeping stoploss below the `FVG` low & previous swing low & targetted for buy side liquidity marked on 5m timefrmae.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s36-tweet.png">

Ict twitted about the same when price took sell side liquidity for its free to run `4143.50` & price delivered in the same manner as it was expected to.

`Note :- Price starts rallying when it takes out opposing side liquidity, If we have strong bias on daily timeframe & price took opposing side liquidity & its also retracing in some sort of FVG + OB then its an high probability trade.`

### Don't trade ahead of Wednesdays's new york open

**1d analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s37-1d.png">

As we can see price had took sell side liquidity recently & given bullish `MSS + FVG` on the daily timefrmae & price already retraced into the `FVG`.

We are expecting price to take the nearest buy side liquidity marked with red line with `4200` & `4290` if it keep rising towards the upside.

`In the upcoming day there is a new event which is not advisable to trade with live money, atleast for beginners but we can study the price how it delivers to liquidity in news enviornment without taking any actual trades.`

**1h analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s37-1h.png">

As you can see the fair value gap marked with blue lines from daily tiemframe & red line is the buy side liquidity which we are expecting to be taken in upcoming days.

As we can notice it recently given Bullish `MSS + FVG` setup so it can retrace it to the `FVG` we pointing on the hourly timeframe & then we expect price to take buy side liquidity marked on the chart.


Lets switch to lower timeframe for more details.

**15m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s37-15m.png">

After the new york open `EST 12:00AM & IST 9:30AM` price traded into the short term fair value gap & rallyed upside where we was expecting price to take buy side liquidity marked with red line.

But we was wrong, price consolidated near the liquidity, dropped down into daily timeframe `FVG`, took out sell side liquidity & daily timeframe `FVG LOW` which would take us out of the trade.

Then it rallyed & took out buy side liquidity & continued rallying.

`Note :- Its advised to stop trading ahead of new york session if you not bagged anything from the sunday's opening & wednsday's new york open.`

**5m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s37-5m.png">

When price took out sell side liquidity & took out `FVG LOW` on daily timeframe that's where was expect to seek for the setup & entry on lower timeframes.

ICT was not available that time didn't took the trade either at that time.

**Ict Twets :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s37-tweet.png">

ICT tweeted after getting back on charts for watch out `IMBALANCE or FVG` on the 5m timeframe where we are expecting price to be drawn, And when ICT Tweets some kind of stuff its not an trade advice but we can focus on it, if it set's up the stage for us by giving setup then we can take entry.

**HOW OUR ENTRY WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s37-2m.png">

As you can see our daily bias was bullish to take out buy side liquidity supporting with 1h timeframe and price retraced into daily order block, took sell side liquidity where we missed the entry.

After that price given `MSS` to short term high & creted the `FVG` as well, in which we was expecting price to be retraced & there is also and bullish order block which creates `MSS + FVG + OB` setup where we will be taking entry by keeping stoploss below recent swing low & targetting for imbalance which ict posted in the tweet.

`Note :- Whenever you are trading fill the empty chart with such pharases that you know that price is going to do that thing in positive way & when you journal your trades alnong with charts, when you go though your trades & analysis after sometime it builds the psychology & confidence which is necessary for our profitability.`

### HOW TO CHAGE GEARS WITH BIAS & HOW TO MANAGE BIAS

**1d analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s38-1d-2.png">

As you can see on daily chart previously we was moving downside on daily timeframe & recently price given BULLISH `MSS` with strong displacement which created `FVG` & price retraced into it once previoulsy & now also retraced into once more.

So according to bias price will take out previous day low, buy side liquidity resting above short term high & intermediate term high.

**1h analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s38-1h.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s38-1-2.png">


As you can see price was taking out sell side liquidity prior to the bullish `MSS` & retraced into `FVG` & rallyed higher.

According to daily bias we are expecting price to take out previous day high & buy side liquidity above the relative equal high's from daily timeframe.

Now if we can notice there is an imbalance as well above the previous day high where price can draw to where 2 permium arrays getting combined together & price is likely to move higher itself due to our confluences.

Let's drop to lower timeframe for more details.

**15m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s38-15m.png">

As we are having bullish bias according to daily timeframe & hourly timeframe, we are able to see the price swing which given `MSS` with strong displacemnt after down move which it th e most high probability one in the available `FVG'S` while price moving towards the buyside liquidity.

`Note :- Not every FVG get filled & Not Every Imbalance gets rebalanced, those are just entry points where we taking entry into the move whihc we are expecting according to higher timeframe bias either its going to take liquidity or rebalancing the price.`

**5m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s38-5m.png">

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s38-5m-2.png">

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s38-5m-3.png">

As you can see we was able to see the `FVG` after giving `MSS` to short term swing high but we are not able to see that on 5m timeframe, but we are able to see the `FVG` for the `intermediate swing high MSS` whihch we will be considering for the entry as we have marked in the second image.

As you can swing lots of things are getting in the confluence for the above setup, `Price below opening price (AMD) + FVG + Draw on sell side liquidity + SMT + OTE retracement` and mainly `clear MARKET STRUTURE SHIFT` to buyside by breaknig intermediate term swing high & all this confluences getting aligned in with the setup.

We will be taking entry when sell side liquidity taken out as like `Smart Money` keeping our stoploss below the swing low & we will be targetting for buy side liquidity & the imbalance for partial `50%` & rest `50%` we will be booking after draw on buy side liquidity.

`Note : - ICT previously expecting price to reach 4070 but price failed to trade to that price point & ICT became wrong, which is acceptable, then ict changed the gears to bullish when he saw the market structure shift to upside, smt divergence & other confluences which we have discussed above. We can be wrong, we need to accept it & we need to move on from that and look for another opportunity by follwing our trading plan.`

`Note :- You can notice price hits the FVG 2 times which is okay but if it retraces more thant 2 times we need to accept that we was wrong & exit the trade if price retraces fvg more than 2 times, `

`Note :- Sometimes even in the Lunch times market gives us the opportunity if market is too active & it also rallies in the lunch hours, we just need to find the opportunity which fits in our setup & we need to regorously follow it along with our trading plan.`

### HOW TO SAVE OUR STOP

**1d & 1h analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s39-tweet.png">

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s39-1d-1h.png">

As you can see ICT  has tweeter that `4070` is having intrest & which means ict expecting price to be traded to `4070`.

On the daily timeframe as we can see price has given bullish `MSS` to intermediate term high & created `FVG` as well but not traded yet into it, we was expecting price to take out sell side liquidity resting below the relative equal low's.

Once price tiven bearish `MSS` we are looking on 1h timeframe for to checkout if it does creates `FVG` & it created.

We will be patiently waiting for price to retrace into that fair value gap & we will be expecting price to retrace into `FVG` on daliy timeframe.

**15m & 5m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s38-15-5m.png">

As you can see on 15m timeframe price retraced into the `houry FVG` & strongly displaced to downside, consolidated little bit & after consolidation when its took out buy side liquidity it moved towards our target for `daily FVG`.

On 15m timeframe as we can see price traded into the `FVG` marked with orange area & given us opportunity to take entry into sell side.

BUT

SOMETHING HAPPEND IN THAT PRICE MOVEMNT THAT IT TRADED ABOVE THE OPENING PRICE & ICT TOOK EXIT OUT OF SHORT POSITION WHICH WE WILL SEE MORE IN DETAILS.

**5m detailed analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s39-5m.png">

You can notice the timing in which price took out buy side liquidity, Its an new york lunch hours `EST 12:00PM TO 1:00PM & IST 9:30PM TO 10:30PM` where price gives the false moves against the direction of the day & when daily range expansion they are proactive price action even in the lunch time periods.

When price took out buy side liquidity, it took out the sellers stop loss who sold at previous swing low's & it drawn new buyers into the market by giving breakout, hence both side traders are trapped now & thats where SMART MONEY will sell the short to pair the buy orders of breakout artists, & will ride the whole move.

When price given breakout to the swing low after draw on buy side liquidity price created our breaker as well as `BEARISH MSS + FVG` setup in which we can take entry by keeping stoploss above the swing high & we will be targetting the `daily FVG high or median` to book our target.

We are able to another setup AT `EST 9:30AM & IST 7:00PM` where price took out buy side liquidity, retraced into FVG & also we having daily bias in the same direction for which we can take entry, by keepint stoploss above the previous swing high & we can target for sell side liquidity.

**Afternoon setup :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s39-1m-aft.png">

As you can see in the afternoon price given bearish breaker setup which also aligns with our 2022 model as price given `MSS + FVG` while breaking previous swing low with strong displacement & it retraces into `FVG`.

we will be taking entry on the retracement by keeping stoploss above previous swing high & we will be targetting for sell side liquidity.

**How we have saved our stop:-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s39-1m.png">

Very first thing price has completed his objective to take sell side liquidity which we have marked with 5m & price already did that & it created more area's for sell side liquiidty.

But you can see price has broken through all the liquidity levels to the upside & also broken strongly the bearish order block which we was expecting as point of resistance if price still willing to go lower.

But it broke market structure as well as besrih order block & also completed its objective to take sell side liquidity whcih indicating towards the `bullish MSS` and that's why we have exited the trade.

`Note :- We need to focus on time rahter setups, because algorithm works based on time & we need to stick to our timings such as London kill zone & New york kill zone for finding similar setup everyday which leads to sucess rather than finding setup & opportnuties everyday no matter what time, it wont be repetable & you wont be able to find the consistency in it. Noted.`

### Price delivery algorithm (Steps to approach charts)

In this section we will be understanding price delivery algorithms & time price theory & how to approach chart step by step.


**Price delivery algorithm :-**

<img src="/assets/2022-mentorship/s39-pd.png">

Price is delivered by an algorithm, there is no buysing selling pressure in the market, Algorithms operates on one important factor is time, at what timings of day, at what timings of week what price should do & then it approaches to the nearest important price levels which holds the liquidity either buy side or sell side and it rebalances the price if there is any imbalance present around certain price levels.

For the algorithm 2-3 timings are crucial, First is `EST 12:00AM & IST 9:30AM` New york midnight open which sets the stage for current day price action, `EST 8:30AM & IST 6:00PM` which is new york open and most of the news events are released at this time & `EST 9:30AM & IST 7:00PM` at which stock markets gets open at New york & Price Delivery algorithm works on New york local timezone.

At `EST 8:30AM & IST 6:00PM` on bearish days & it takes out buy side liquidity & on bullish day's takes sell side liquidity, gives `MSS with strong displacement` & if it creates `FVG` & retrace it just take the entry every single day.


**Steps for approaching chart for analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s39-pd-2.png"> 

- Checkout the daily & hourly timeframe for checking either price is drawing towards an liquidity area or its drawing towards an imbalance area & decide your bias & then only switch to lower timeframes for analysis.
  
- First mark the important timings of the day such as `EST 8:30AM & IST 6:00PM` as new york opening, New york midnight open.

- Draw the levels where liquidity around those times & price levels and see what price does in those timezones.
  
- The price currently trading at the time see what is price trying to do on macros & is that macro's matching with daily bias.

- If macro's matching with daily bias then look for the opportunity where price will takeout either liquidity or retraces into `FVG` and then plan the entry, sl & exit according to your trading plan.

`Note :- In the first image we was not able to see how to approach the chart, what to see & what to not, but after follwing this approach consistently you will be able to see through the charts without even the markings.`

### Model wrapping up on forex

In this section we will be wrapping up 2022 model in forex market as its our second last lecture for the end of 2022 mentorship.

**1d & 1h analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s40-1-1h.png">

On the daily timeframe we are price given sweep on previous swing high liquidity but not drawn the whole liquidity, due to the same price is likely to draw on buy side liquidity, but as we know before that move it will take out sell side liquidity for for moving drastically to reach our destination.


On the hourly timeframe we are able to see clearly the liquidty sweep for the previous swing high & price traded down to & we are expecting price to take out daily timeframe relative equal lows.

So according to our higher timeframe bias as of now we are expecting downside move.

**15m & 5m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s40-15-5m.png">

ICT had tweeted about to notice sellside & buyside liquidity on 5 & 15m charts.

As you can see after new york kill zone open `EST 7:00AM & 10:00AM & IST 4:30PM TO 7:30PM` price took out buy side liquidity after which we will be waiting for bearish `MSS + FVG` setup.

It given shallow run to sell side liquidty & created `FVG` in which we can take the entry but the displacement was not strong enough & we will be waiting for strong displacement to downside & expecting price to retrace back to FVG.

If we get the entry we will be looking for price to draw sell side liquidity according to our daily bias or the imbalance drawn on chart for booking the partials.

**4m analysis & Model :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s40-4m.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s40-4m-2.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s40-4m-3.png">

`As you can see due to strong displacement on sell side FVG having higher range & in forex specifically price expected to rebalance that price by retracing into the FVG TOP.`

Rather than considering third candle high for considering `FVG` we will be considring `4th candle` high so we wont be having huge stoploss & we will be taking entry into that fair valu gap as represented in the 2nd image.

After taking entry we will be keeping the stoploss according to our model itself abov the previous swing high, but as you can notice we have kept the stoploss aven above that.

WHY???

Because there is an `HIGHER FVG` where price can retrace possibly so for not getting out of the trade prematurely we will be keeping the soploss above the the `FVG` candle of `HIGHER FVG`.

We will be targetting the imbalance which we drawn for partial profit booking & we will be exiting our rest position after draw on sell side liquidity.

**EMINI S&P Revision :-**

**1h analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s40-1h.png">

As you can see we was expecing price to take out buy side liquidity according to our daily bias & now price is retracing in the imbalance which can act as reversal.

So we will wait for `MSS` & if it gives `BULLISH MSS` means price will likely to take out buy side liquidity according to daily bias and we will be shifting to smaller timeframe for finding the setups & also its alerady in its premium.

If we are willing to buy & we are clear with direction we should take entry in discounted price & if sellside then we should take entry in premium.


**15m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s40-15m.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s40-5m.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s40-5m-2.png">

As you can see according to our bullish bias, price traded into an `FVG + OB` after NEW YORK MIDNIGHT OPENING in london kill zone price retraced and it was also below the opening price.

If we are an london trader we can take entry by keeping stoploss below previous swing low & we will be targetting price to be rebalancing into hourly FVG.

If we are not an london trader we can enter into the trade whne price is retraced into an `FVG` which caused due to `Bullish MSS` and we will be targetting for the same hourly FVG.

You can notice in the new york kill zone price took out sell side liquidity which is our `market maker model` + It created `MSS + FVG` setup along with it which makes it higher probability because price will not take trade lower to our entry because it already took out sell side liquidity so.

**FUTURES & FOREX CO-RELATION :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s40-ff-cor.png">

As the base currency of USDCAD is USD & if USD is dropping lower means other market will be likely to go higher.

As USD is dropping lower means EMINI S&P will rise higher according to their fundamentals.

### Daily Bias rules 

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s41-db.png">

If we are struggling with daily bias, we have some set of rules for figuring out the daily bias, Please note that it will not be necessary that you will be having right daily bias everyday, Eventually with experience it will get enhanced & accuracy might also improve.

**Rules :-**

- **Every day bias is unrealistic :-** We wont be correct every day and we need to accept it.

- **Determine the likely weekly expansion :-** We need to determine weekly bias according to liquidity its targetting & or its trying to rebalance the price and on which side.

- **Look for Obvious liquidity that direction :-** Look for relative equal low's or high's where price is likely to run & checkout previously it took which side liquidity so its likely to take another side liquidity after one side's.

- **Identify Imbalancec in price delivery in top down :-** We need to look for imbalances from higher timeframe to lower timeframe to make sure that if they are in sync.

- **Focus On High or medum calender events date :-** Trade on only those days which are likely to have medium or high impact news because those are only days where the best setup forms.

- **Look for Directional price runs in kill zones :-** The kill zone you are trading checkout where price is willing to go for draw on liquidity or rebalancing the price.


### 2022 SERIES END

This would be the last section of 2022 mentorship & we will be having look on the guidance of ICT about this mentorship along with EMINI S&P analysis.

**1h analysis :-**

<img src="/assets/2022-mentorship/s41-1h.png">

As you can see price took out sell side liquidity as marked on the chart & we was expcting price to take out the buy side liquidity resting above the `3805` & we was planning for short trade after draw on liquidity.

**15m analysis :-**
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s41-15m.png">

As you can see when price took out buy side liquidity ict had entered into long position for targetting buy side liquidity resting above the `3080` level.

But after that price took stoploss of ICT & retraced into `BULLISH FVG` & in the NY PM Session it given bullish `MSS` to the relative equal high's.

Lets switch to lower timefrmae for more details.

**5m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s41-5m.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s41-5m-2.png">

As you can see after retracing into 15m `FVG` price given `BULLISH MSS + FVG` setup in the PM session after `EST 1:30PM & IST 11:00PM`.

We will be taking entry on the retracement of FVG & we will be targetting buy side liquidity resting above `3080` by keeping stoploss below the previous swing low.

**4m analysis :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s41-4m.png">

As you can see we have marked the `FVG` occured after `BULLISH MSS` after strong displacement ICT took the entry on that `FVG` for expecting price to go beyond `3805.50`.

But It took out buy side liquidity & dropped down, this is the reason we need to book our partial profits so we will be having something booked before trade goes against us.

After that it given `BEARISH MSS` but the displacement wasn't strong enough so again it given `BEARISH MSS + FVG` setup but this time with strong displacement which we can could have took entry by targetting `15M FVG` by keeping stoploss above previous swing high.

**PM Session :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s41-4m-pm.png">
<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s41-4m-pm2.png">

As you can see around `EST 1:00PM & IST 10:30PM` price given `MSS + FVG + OB + OTE` which is golden setup in itself.

We can take entry on retracement on ob or fvg or ote & we will be targetting for the nearest buy side liquidity & futher liquidity levels for partial profit booking but our main objective would be buy side liquidity above `3080` by keeping stoploss below previuos swing low's.

### Risk Management & Stoploss Trailing

In this section we will be having look on risk management in the 2022 model.

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s41-rm.png">

We need to risk 1% of our equity for the standard account but if we are trading with prop firms we need to risk only `0.25 to 1%` so with the help of that we will be able to take atleast 40 trades in the 10% drawdown & in 20 trades we can pass the challenge.

If we are confident about the trade we had mastered out setup we can maximum risk 2% of standard account & we can risk `0.5% - 1%` of prop firm account.

For calculating the lot size we have websites such as forexfactory.com & others according to our requirements.

`Note :- If we have lost the trade then we need to cut down our risk to half & if we win the trades we keep our risk consistent to 1%.`

**Stop Management :-**

<img src="./assets/2022-mentorship/s41-sm.png">

When our price reaches 50% our target we trail the stoploss by 25% of the risk & when price reaches to 75% of target then we can trail our stoploss to breakeven or above breakeven so you wont be in loss due to brokerage or charges.

**Partial Profits :-**

We need to book the partial profits from our trade because sometimes doesn't deliver price to expected price levels but whatever move it made & if we are booking partial profits out of it which means we are still in profits and the successrate as well as captital will increase eventually.
