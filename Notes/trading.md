### Demand Zone in Chart

Demand zone is the price zone in which there are the buyers are waiting over there to buy the stocks at that price points and the demand zone line or trend line should connect with atleast 2 points and if it indicates more than 3-4 points then its very strong demand zone over there.

### Supply Zone in Chart

Supply zone is the price zone in which there are the sellers are waiting over there to sell the stocks at that price points and the supply zone line or trend line should connect with atleast 2 points and if it indicates more than 3-4 points then its very strong supply zone over there.

### ShortSelling

**Rules :-**

1. When the price will breakdown the major demand zone then you should shortsell.

2. When the price will retrace till a point in the downtreand then you should shortsell the stock.

### Risk and Reward Ratio

**In the risk reward ratio should first think about the loss and then profit.**

Find the trade in which there are less amount too the loss and more amount towards the profit then only you should take that trade.

Ex : -
<img src="./rnr.png">

1. In the above example down line is the demand zone and upline is the supply zone.

2. Current stock price is `2162.00` and the trend is downtrend soo if we think about the shortsell at the current price it can only got max till the demand zone which is `2120.00` soo the profit will be only `Rs.40` and if the stock bounces upside till the supply zone then the loss will be `Rs.210` soo in this trade the loss hits then we can loose huge money soo this kind of trade we should avoid in which the risk is higher then the profit.

BUTTTTT

3. If the current price `2162.00` breaks down the demand zone on `2120.00` and reach till the `2110` soo the demand zone will be turned into the supply zone after breakdown and the till the supply zone the loss would be only `Rs.10` but it can go far down bcoz its breaked the demand zone soo this kind of trade we should take.

**Most Imp :- The risk is to reward ratio should be 1 is to 2 soo your profit booked should be (risk price x 2) and your target price should be double as your loss price soo you can square off from the position with the safe trade.**

### Stop Loss

Stop loss it the price at which we cant bare more loss than that soo basically stop loss will be a maximum loss peak point we can bare and it should be minimum than your profit booking should be double of it soo the trade will be profitable.

**Most Imp :- Stop should be demand zone while buying in uptrend and supply zone in selling in the downtrend.**
